Russia could go bankrupt and end the war in Ukraine.\u00a0 I think we live in an horrible world, and I was said it is the only one we have. I have to keep trying. I am not given a voice in any news media in the world. Being everything else the same a country without gold is wealthier, live better thanks to their understanding of money, that is transferable debt, a number that indicates value and a name, the issuer of the promise to give value for value at the same market value or price and different utility for buyer and seller, otherwise the exchange would not take place, benefiting both equally, increasing equally their wealth, than a country with gold that protect a yellow, bright, durable, divisible, mouldable, electric conductor, not particularly beautiful, and rare mineral useless inside a vault, because in the country with no gold don\u2019t have to work to pay the extreme cost of mining, transportation, minting, storage, protection. Gold is not money and exchanging gold for goods and services is barter.\u00a0Gold mining would end when the price collapse as all the gold reserves in the world are sold, being the last the foolest, and companies would not be profitable saving the environment from destruction.\nIs not absurd to have to dig out gold to exchange goods and services? Money can be created to buy to sell costless without authorisation because is a sellable contract to give value for value, fulfilled with honour and accepted voluntarily if the issuer is trustworthy, and can be stored in the mind. \u201cI promise i would give the bearer the price in value without cheating, lying, hiding, stealing aiming at giving satisfaction, wellbeing, wealth, happiness.\u201d\nKind regards,\nMiguel.",

Before agreeing to buy the company outright on April 14, he owned 73 million shares at an average price of $36.16.\n\nTwitter shares hit $51.70 on April 25 - which would have represented a $1.1 billion profit for Musk. But they've since fallen 31% to below $36 - turning that billion-dollar gain into a $40 million loss.\n\nTwitter fell 6% Tuesday as investors sold off social media and advertising stocks after Snap announced it would miss its second-quarter revenue target.

What simple freedom for ordinary people to  just be able to speak common sense again is considered \"oppression and fascism\" by these woke dictators who demand nothing less than absolute power over all speech and thought.  \n\nThe most dangerous thing Twitter feared most was people having a chance to see what truth looks like."

Why do you think Biden has been giving away all our tax dollars and military equipment? But to make the U.S. even more vulnerable, and more susceptible, to a ONE World Government! \n\nI mean, do you honestly think Russia, China, or even India, will sell us any Steel with which to make weapons? No! They will simply offer us Protection, for a Price! Hell even Mexico knows this. Which is why they have already allied themselves with Russia & China.

They are more animal than human.\n\nTwitter employees should be pitted but never excused.",
            "Twitter is worth way less than 1 B take it or leave it. They are worth nothing with their scam and liars. Elon should not pay more than 1B. The CEO is an Indian !!! any questions?? Without Trump, no one knows Twitter.",
            "Let's think about this logically - if any social media had the capability to determine with 100% accuracy which accounts are bots - they would be using that technology.\nThis isn't hard. They already do attempt to filter out as many bots as they can, and estimate there are more at any given time that they do not catch.\nThe reason Elon Musk also won't be able to determine the # of bots is because it's an unsolvable problem with the variables given. You must by necessity make assumptions.",
            "Now Elon Musk is scrolling over the data feeling like a moron realizing the complexity with determining a precise % for bots with vast amounts of data necessarily having to make broad assumptions lol.\nGood luck.",
            "Free speech is not the same of right of defamation. The good thing about Twitter being purged of fake accounts, is that suing for defamation become possible, because in a free society anybody can say anything, but being accountable of every word."

        "description": "CNBC's 'Squawk Box' discuss a recent Twitter poll from Tesla CEO Elon Musk asking users whether he should sell 10% of his shares in the company. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla shares fell by more than 4% in early morning trading Monday after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock in the electric vehicle company.\n\nShares of Tesla slipped 4.2% to $1,170 at 8:19 a.m. ET Monday, down from $1,222.09 at market close on Friday. Earlier in pre-market trade on Monday, shares fell over 7%.\n\nIt comes after Musk asked his 62.5 million Twitter followers to determine the future of a chunk of his Tesla holdings.\n\nIn a Twitter poll launched Saturday, Musk said: \u201cMuch is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. Do you support this?\u201d\n\nThe billionaire gave people the option to vote \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d and pledged to abide by the results of the poll, whichever way it went.\n\nSome 3,519,252 people responded, and 57.9% of them voted for \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMusk previously said he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his shares in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn September, Musk said at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California, that his marginal tax rate will be over 50% when his stock options expire at Tesla, and that he was already planning to sell soon.\n\n\u201cI have a bunch of options that are expiring early next year, so ... a huge block of options will sell in Q4 \u2014 because I have to or they\u2019ll expire,\u201d he said.\n\n Jefferies raised their price target for shares of Tesla from $950 to $1,400 in a note on Monday.\n\nAnalyst Philippe Houchois wrote: \u201cWithout dismissing execution risk, Tesla is getting to a position where it can balance affordability and speed, goals which are as important as profitability in Elon Musk\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTesla looks set to gain share from large OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], potentially claiming a disproportionate share of the industry profit pool in the coming 3-5 years as legacies enter the margin dilutive EV transition phase.\u201d\n\nOther current and former Tesla board members, including Robyn Denholm, Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias have also offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla stock since Oct. 28, as the company\u2019s stock soared on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nShares climbed after Tesla posted a record third quarter and car rental company Hertz announced that it was ordering 100,000 Tesla vehicles for its fleet. Musk waited for a week after Hertz made its announcement to say that Tesla had not in fact signed a contract with the company yet. Prior to that statement, he taunted investors who were short shares of Tesla on Twitter, writing: \u201cTesla Hertz shorts.\u201d\n\nSince the Hertz announcement, Tesla shares have risen by more than 30% and so has Musk\u2019s net worth.\n\nElon\u2019s tax bill\n\nNo matter the results of the Twitter poll, Musk would have likely started selling millions of shares this quarter. That\u2019s because he\u2019s facing a looming tax bill of more than $15 billion.\n\nHis options expire in August 2022 but in order to exercise them, he has to pay the income tax on the gain.\n\nSince the options are taxed as an employee benefit or compensation, they will be taxed at top ordinary-income levels, or 37% plus the 3.8% net investment tax. He will also have to pay the 13.3% top tax rate in California since the options were granted and mostly earned while he was a California tax resident.\n\nCombined, the state and federal tax rate will be 54.1%. So the total tax bill on his options, at the current price, would be $15 billion.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

            "Its hilarious how people forget where Musk came from. He is a software guy first. He made his first million selling internet software. Musk has said 20+ years ago that there are three things important to future of humanity: Internet (Twitter/Starlink), Sustainable Energy (Tesla), and Multiplanetary species (SpaceX). He's just getting back into what he's done a long ago. \nWhat more hilarious is just a few years ago, everyone claimed Musk is a software guy, he's not a manufacturer guy. Now the argument is reversed. Its just pure silliness at this point. Just reactionary.",
            "Doubters, doubters, doubters.",
            "Did we forget about PayPal ?",
            "The reason why Elon Musk buys Twitter is because the stock market is now very overvalued and close to crash in a couple of months due to hike rates, debt, and the crisis generated by China, Ukraine, Russia. Not only does the stock market can crash, the dollar and bitcoin can crash as well. So, Elon sells part of his shares of Tesla and others (now overvalued), buys Twitter (excuse for not saying that the stock market is going to crash), privatizes Twitter, to avoid the Twitter stock price to crash, and in this way Elon protects its wealth. Then a few years later when the market stabilizes again, Twitter goes again public, and Elon recovers his wealth. Master play, Twitter is just a good excuse to make cash with his investments without making a lot of noise."

            "How to Play the Game of Life\r\nWhy do children wake up with their eyes wide open and jump out of bed while we open them just wide enough to see the phone so we can set it to snooze? Why are young people energetic and ready to \u201cconquer the world\u201d while older people are cautious and hesitant? Can we stay young-spirited forever? After all, if life is not a game, there is no excitement in it. And if there is no excitement in life, what is the point of living?\r\nIf we want to keep enjoying, we need to make life a lifelong game. This game is very different from anything we know. It is not about what we can receive, but about what we can discover! By connecting to other people, we discover new worlds, other people\u2019s worlds!\r\nHow do we achieve this? Quite simply, we need to focus on others rather than on ourselves. This may sound simple, but if you try it, you will realize how self-absorbed you are.\r\nWe are all like that. Even those who feel that they are generous and giving are absorbed in their giving and do not see how much they do it for their own interest, and how they are focused on their own benefit when they give. Giving is fine, but the focus is the point here. Had the focus been on the receiver, the giver would have discovered countless revelations that are hidden from a self-centered eye.\r\nFor the game to succeed, you need partners. It is impossible to play the game of giving without people to whom you can give and from whom you can receive. Therefore, there must be a group of people, up to ten or so, who play the game together.\r\nIn order to succeed in discovering the other players\u2019 worlds, we need to think good thoughts about them. Otherwise, we will have no incentive to approach them, no desire to discover their world. We can think good thoughts about each other if we do good things for one another. These can be the simplest things, but they must make us feel good about each other. Positive thoughts about each other bring us closer, and closeness opens our minds and hearts to others, so we can see the world through their eyes.\r\nAs with any game, the more we practice, the better we get, and the harder, yet more rewarding the game becomes. But unlike any other game, as we improve in it, we will find that our entire perspective on life changes and expands, and we become wiser and more competent.\r\nThe game of life, unlike any other game, reveals to us the secrets of life, the secrets of reality, because when you can look at something from all angles, nothing remains hidden from you.",
            "Elon Musk in the last month has enraged the authoritarian progressives that love Twitter suppressing free speech AND Putin who wanted to silence Ukrainians by destroying their Internet when he provided Starlink access, so the world saw what was happening in the Ukraine.  So, his commitment to free speech has put the Twitter Board and Putin in the same boat.  Let that sink in for a second",
            "I think this clown suffers from Napoleonic Complex Syndrome.  LOL, he has to compensate for his little stature by playing these posturing games.  In reality he doesn\u2019t even have $40B lying around.  He\u2019d have to borrow it.  He\u2019s a huge embarrassment to the billionaire class.  LOL.",
