Tools for team management:
We used GitHub to collaborate, allowing us to store, track, and manage code, as well as work together on projects efficiently. Secondly, we used Trello to organize tasks, track progress, and collaborate on projects visually. Additionally, we used Microsoft Teams to discuss progress each week and help each other when someone was stuck.
