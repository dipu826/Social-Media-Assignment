This comes after Tesla got a preliminary go-ahead earlier this year to also bring his Full Self Driving platform to China, where the robotaxi ecosystem has moved beyond trials to actual - albeit limited - autonomous taxi service on public roads. Our Chief North Asia Correspondent Stephen Engle explores how Tesla\u2019s FSD stacks up against Chinese competitors.\r\n--------\r\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\r\n \r\nLike this video?

The fight was bloody. \n\nSo now you want a union-won workweek from a guy who hates unions? That\u2019s really funny. He also made it clear that\u2019s the minimum, so no, he\u2019s not demanding a normal standard workweek. My guess is it\u2019s closer to 60. Yay sweatshops! \ud83d\ude2e",

            "Too many people trying to challenge their work place because they are unhappy, just go work somewhere else. You want to get a paycheck somewhere, you have to follow the rules. If you don\u2019t want to, go start your own business, be your own boss.",
            "Go open up your own company and work from home 20 hrs a week. Let me see how far you\u2019re going to go with that concept. Secondly, I\u2019m 69 , now retired after 45 years of work. As far as I remembered you either work part time or full time 40 hrs a week. Thirdly, is Elon Musk forcing you to work for him? Go find another job.",
            "Working 7 days was common long ago\n**but people identified they need rest and time for family**\n\nWorking 5 days for 40 hours came \n**but people are identifying inflation and for cost of living and savings, it is no more a viable way of working**\n\nNo practice is permanent, adapt to new challenges and companies should observe this"

            "Victory\nIn the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.[48:29]\nMuhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers wiith (the sight of) them. Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward.\n\n\n[33:45]\nO Prophet! Lo! We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner.\n\n[33:46]\nAnd as a summoner unto Allah by His permission, and as a lamp that giveth light.\n\n[33:47]\nAnd announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great bounty from Allah.\n\n[33:48]\nAnd incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their noxious talk, and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.\n\n[4:69]\nWhoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they!\n\n[4:70]\nThat is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower.\n\n\n[7:155]\nAnd Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when the trembling came on them, he said: My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did ? It is but Thy trial (of us). Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness.\n\n\n[7:156]\nAnd ordain for us in this world that which is good, and in the Hereafter (that which is good), Lo! We have turned unto Thee. He said: I smite with My punishment whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things, therefore I shall ordain it for those who ward off (evil) and pay the poor- due, and those who believe Our revelations;\n\n\n[7:157]\nThose who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with them. He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong. He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul; and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear. Then those who believe in him, and honour him, and help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him: they are the successful.\n\n\n[7:158]\nSay (O Muhammad): O mankind! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah to you all - (the messenger of) Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and He giveth death. So believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believeth in Allah and in His Words, and follow him that haply ye may be led aright.\n\n\n[33:56]\nLo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.\n\n\n[66:8]\nO ye who believe! Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands; they will say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! Lo! Thou art Able to do all things.\n\n\n[21:107]\nWe sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\u061b",

But the negatives are he doesn't know when to be quiet or when to talk. He talks  what he thinks at the moment with out thinking of the consequences, which is might irked with the likes of Gates, Cook, Buffet. Remember when Musk had a encounter with the SEC because of his Tesla declaration. That doesn't sit well with them and even I agree, sure trash talking might motivate you, but it has its limits and limitations ( remember the submarine and diver issue and the kids).

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi\u00a0\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has sold another 934,090 shares, or about $1.02 billion worth of his holdings, in his electric car and solar business according to financial filings published late Tuesday.\n\nMusk also exercised options to buy nearly 1.6 million Tesla shares at a strike price of $6.24 per share, granted to him via a 2012 compensation package.\n\nIn exercising his options this quarter, Musk\u2019s holdings in Tesla have increased from about 170.5 million shares to over 177 million shares, the Wall Street Journal first reported.\n\nSince Nov. 8, Musk has been on a selling spree, partly to pay his looming tax bills on those options.\n\nThe celeb-CEO polled his tens of millions of Twitter followers in the first week of November asking if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. They voted yes. But a major portion of the sales that followed the entertaining Twitter poll were part of a plan that Musk adopted in September this year.\n\nUnder 10b5-1 rules, corporate insiders (including CEOs) can trade their own equity as part of pre-announced portfolio management plan. They must declare in advance when and how they plan to trade to protect themselves from later accusations of insider trading.\n\nThis year, Tesla shares have risen more than 54% making Musk the world\u2019s wealthiest person. His net worth is now over $275 billion, according to estimates by Forbes.\n\nThat wealth is derived from Musk\u2019s ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. He currently doesn\u2019t take a salary or cash bonuses, and had not sold a large number of shares in Tesla until this year. He had, instead, taken out sizable loans against a portion of his Tesla shares.\n\nSince taxpayers only pay taxes on income or stock once it is sold, Musk never paid a large amount in taxes annually relative to his net worth, ProPublica previously reported.\n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tweeted that Musk was \u201cfreeloading off everyone else,\u201d since he didn\u2019t pay federal income taxes in 2018.\n\nNow, Musk is expected to pay what is likely to be the largest single individual tax bill in U.S. history, with federal and California income taxes estimated to top $11 billion. He will be required to pay this tax bill in order to receive compensation of more than $23 billion, in the form of stock options that would otherwise expire in August.\n\nThe centi-billionaire discussed his riches and tax strategy during a bevy of December press appearances, including interviews with the Financial Times and Time Magazine after both outlets both named him person of the year for 2021.\n\nCapping off his year-end publicity efforts, Elon Musk sat with the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee on Tuesday last week. During that interview he said, \u201cI sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here.\u201d\n\nThe next day on Twitter, Musk clarified, \u201cThis assumes completion of the 10b sale.\u201d And noted, \u201cWhen the 10b preprogrammed sales complete. There are still a few tranches left, but almost done\u201d in a subsequent tweet.\n\nBy some estimates, Musk still has more than a million more shares to sell to reach his 10% November target of around 17 million shares. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment or more information about the sum total he plans to sell to hit that goal.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Besides, he now has the algorythm software to implement into his Starlink/Web3/auto-pilot electric car/6G phone system... how much is that worth??? Priceless!!! Elon can dismantle and cannibalize Twitter completely and still have everything he needs to rock the ENTIRE world! He is the first person to possess ALL the pieces and tech to privatize space/blockchain/Web3 and give the power back to the people from the alphabet \"cloak and dagger\" society.

David has been censored from most/or all mainstream, and, even, alternative media sources. He is a former footballer and sports broadcaster (British)  who wrote over 20 books (self-published since the mid-1990s) and has spoken in more than 25 countries--he is now banned from entering most of those countries now.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk sold nearly $5 billion in Tesla stock, according to financial filings out Wednesday evening. He still holds more than 166 million shares.\n\nHis trust sold more than 3.5 million shares worth over $3.88 billion in a flurry of trades carried out Tuesday and Wednesday. Those transactions were not marked as 10b5, meaning they were not scheduled sales.\n\nEarlier Wednesday evening, filings showed Musk is selling a separate block of Tesla shares via a plan that he set in motion on Sept. 14 this year. Those sales amount to more than 930,000 shares worth over $1.1 billion.\n\nMusk sold these shares in part to satisfy tax obligations related to an exercise of stock options.\n\nBefore that sale plan was made public, Musk asked his 62.5 million Twitter followers to vote in an informal poll, telling them their vote would determine the future of his Tesla holdings. The filings reveal that, in fact, he knew some of his shares were slated for sale this week.\n\nFollowing the Twitter poll, shares of Tesla slumped more 15% over Monday and Tuesday, before rebounding more than 4% on Wednesday.\n\nThe stock was higher in after-hours trade on Thursday.\n\nCitadel CEO Ken Griffin, speaking at the DealBook Online Summit on Wednesday, said he personally did not want to see Musk sell. \u201cIndividuals like Elon Musk, like Jeff Bezos have transformed life, and we want to keep them in control of their companies, as long as they\u2019ve got the energy and the ambition to keep moving the business forward.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Musk signaled that he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his options in the fourth quarter. At an appearance at the Code Conference in September, Musk said when his stock options expire at Tesla, his marginal tax rate would be over 50%.\n\nCurrent and former board members including chairwoman Robyn Denholm, Elon Musk\u2019s brother Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias have offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla shares since Oct. 28 after Tesla\u2019s market cap surpassed $1 trillion.\n\nAmong those insider sales, Kimbal Musk\u2019s was the only transaction that was not listed as a 10b5, or planned sale. Kimbal Musk sold around $109 million worth of his shares a day ahead of his brother\u2019s Twitter poll.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

A fascinating insight into the mind of the now billionaire entrepreneur Elon.  Elon was asked about what he would tell those who shorted Tesla stock at the time.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe to The Motley Fool's YouTube Channel: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/MotleyFool?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow The Motley Fool on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/themotleyfoolofficial/\nJoin our Facebook community:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/themotleyfool\nFollow  The Motley Fool on TikTok:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@themotleyfoolofficial?\nFollow The Motley Fool on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/themotleyfool\n\n#ElonMusk #Tesla #Shorts",

Tesla is valued over $1 trillion so why is it being shorted because Tesla only sells a fraction of the cars that the other manufacturers do. So for Tesla to actually match its valuation it will have to capture the market share of all those companies to justify its $1 trillion+ valuation call me old fashioned but that\u2019s not going to happen. Now say Tesla starts selling more cars and matches the sales of Toyota which would be an incredible achievement in the automotive industry it\u2019s current valuation would have to fall by around 90% that\u2019s gonna sting.",

Rich people like him are able to avoid liquidation (and hence taxes) by taking a huge loan from the bank and using their stock as collateral. That is a MAJOR loophole that needs to be closed. Other than that, he should really stop whining about a one-time billionaires tax, which would be used to fund _the very same infrastructure_ his products depend on! And not only that, but he could only have made a profit if he took advantage of the infrastructure that was paid with taxpayer's money (distribution services using public highways, employees commuting to work, etc.). Yes, it's about time he pays back into the system, and all others like him who were able to reap the benefits of a rigged game for far too long. Would he rather see poor ol' Joe across the street who's barely able to afford rent pay more in taxes than he does? I sure hope not; but there is no doubt in my mind that _some_ billionaires in this country would secretly answer in the affirmative. I'm all for space exploration --- but let's make sure that the basic needs of the American people (healthcare, housing, education, etc.) are met first. Are we all okay with that? Good.\n\nAnd by the way, I voted yes on that Twitter poll. Now let's hope the next one is about whether he should pay the same tax rate as everyone else, let alone more.",

            "As usual people are missing the point with Elon and Tesla. His companies are very successful, strong and resourceful... this is a natural effect from 1st principles thinking and not a neccesitive goal of Elon and his mission. He must enter India for there is where many cars are spewing pollutants into the environment....and so this environment must transition asap. It just so happens that the best way to transition a market quickly is to also do so intelligently. The irony is Tesla can appear as a ruthless competitor taking over the market when in fact they are merely sticking to a simple original path. Tesla will work and will succeed and will become the largest  company to ever exist while simultaneously transforming the earths biosphere/ecosystem into a much healthier, vibrant, ALIVE one. When you include the other components to Elons mission such as x app in particular... meant to be the everything app built by the person who is likely one of the best \"off the cuff\"/out of box thinking programmers on the planet combined with a HUGE TEAM, an army if you will,  of people who are the best at what they do AND are given an excellent wage and benefits... why? Because its nice, because it is the right thing to do, sure both these things... but is is smart money wise... short term, creating a \"lean mean fighting machine\" as is the general business model... absolutely not... but is it the wisest... the most intelligent... long term \"tactic\" for the overall mission? Yes. Why ... because the missions success is all that matters, first principles thinking is literally the first principle and the purpose of the mission/business itself... accruing wealth, power, market share etc are.merwly symptoms of.a.mission succeeding..... why? Because Elon created a company to make hime.the richest in the world ever? No, to make him the most powerful man on earth able to move mts at a whim? No... and to be honest Elon is none of these things, although it may appear so and many media presentations will focus on this b3ing the case the are.missing.the forrest for the trees. I will explain this all simply and we should all hope, pray and.even assist in any waynpossible towards this \"mission\" because it is not Elon who is the richest, most powerful being on.the earth, getring stronger and more powerful lite4ally by the nanosecond",

He is experiencing cognitive dissonance trying to reconcile the reality of this major set back to his goals for Tesla and frankly the human race. In this light he sees possessions, his car collection, etc. to be irrelevant trappings. He is having a midlife crisis angry-at-god moment on steroids!. Thirdly, he is angry with himself fir not anticipating the seriousness of viruses. For example, how do you make plans to be an interplanetary species without building this fundamentally into the equation.

            "Here's what it may look like to steer someone wrong as a\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f please after. Neglect to have a separation from the court in that, the job of finding evidence to convict is with the court. So a dirty people \ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0fwould have someone confess to a crime, tell them where, when, who,. Then those cops will say they're good\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f detectives when the information they gathered wasn't constitutionally allowed. It says a person can't self incriminate. Which is how it leads to the court saying the burden of proof rests with\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f courts. They rephrase a part of the constitution. So once they do there quasi job, the court isn't supposed to acknowledge any of that stuff yet its \ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0fa dirty game. Dirty game. Ya hear how they sound when they say \"get on the ground\".??? Okay. \ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\n\n      If they're talking to you in any tone outside if that they're trying to dirtily get you to do jail time. You see the path, once seen is visible. What else. If they never showed you a\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f copy of the constitution, you were or will be toyed with. Also\ud83e\udee0. They wont show it to you.\n     Your own attorney may be agaisnt yiu so be careful. So yeah sometimes\ud83e\udee0 typing this will come back on me. Let's say someone want me ded. They can use this to beat the charges. \n     Let's say you get arrested. What you don't know. Don't answer any questions. Instead say I have to see \ud83e\udee0an attorney first. They will get an attitude. Listen this the sauce.  If they force you to answer, any questions by force...i think you're on your way to being\ud83e\udee0 able to get your charges dropped...given you didn't do something on camera. N even if you did.\ud83e\udee0 Let's say yiure scared, okay boom. The next step is to know theyre dirty so keep in mind that includes every nice face you talk to\ud83e\udee0 while arrested also going to court. Whatelse?\nProtect ya mindset around these afsers. \ud83e\udee0\n    If you're given anything to sign, don't. Next typically they have\ud83e\udee0 gear that weighs them down, so of you are going to engage them physically that's the risk of your life. They may decide to take a gun out instead of a laser similar to how they did my buddy in Charlotte,NC. So if you run it's a charge if they\ud83e\udee0 catch you n pair the crime to you. If you physically engage, you risk two charges. Attempted moordah, also resisting arrest. It's best to keep your mind clear,\ud83e\udee0 commit to one plan then decide that clean law n order shall prevail. If you want to run away, don't forget if that gun is drawn the doo doo\ud83e\udee0 heads may pop ya. What else. Ah. The dog n backup. How to behave if it gets to a dog. I've heard of you attack\ud83e\udee0 the dog, it's a charge on a please afser,. If your a minority assume they have backup on the way in your blindspot or behind you. What else. When seeking an attorney after you deciding to put your fingers behind your back. Idk. You may decide a minority, yet idk. \ud83e\udee0Who do they idolize \ud83e\udee0in your state. If you don't hear negative stories about your people go with the same race. If yiu hear people being mistreated in stores, restaurants etc, choose the best wheet attorney you mesh with. N if you get arrested,\ud83e\udd22 because I typed this given that you don't do any of my people dirty.  ...I'll miss ya\ud83e\udd22.

I've been hearing, reading and listening by all manufacturer's, all their issues, recalls and excuses, plus all the lawsuits they were under and mostly settled with an NDA to people in said lawsuits. Dealers have spent years lying to customers, scamming them, not even telling customers about recalls pertaining to their cars or brand. Tesla has shaken the car industry, they were created in 2003 and they started producing cars in 2008, no dealers per say as other manufacturers. So within 14 years, they never changed their models really, they improved their cars, updated software and they work. Unlike other manufacturers throughout the years that changes their model every 3 to 4 years, with new engines, transmissions, rear end etc, but they never got them right, but hey it's ok, we are bringing out our new model next year \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 I like Tesla for what they achieved from a little time they've existed \ud83d\ude09 Hopefully as new batteries are created and implemented, they can increase the range to 500 to 700 KM and charges everywhere \ud83d\ude09"

They're continuing to ramp up production and they're using the retail price of the vehicle as the valve mechanism to control order flow relative to production.  No doubt as production continues to grow the price will continue to come down, but I don't believe for a second this has anything to do with pricing vs competition, particularly given competitors in the EV space are manufacturing and selling at such low volumes still.  \n\nOther manufactures stuff vehicles into the dealer sales channel, and the dealers have these big discount sales to move volume, and there's no reporting on that because it's not as visible at the manufacturer level the way it is for Tesla.  Even right now Ford is pushing low interest financing for example, higher offers on used car trade-ins to incentive new vehicle sales, or dealerships will offer lower rates on last year's vehicle models that haven't sold, etc.\n\nEV's are new tech, and new tech ALWAYS goes this way.  It always starts out more expensive and they capture as many early adopters at the higher price that they can, then the price continually comes down as they get better and cheaper at manufacturing.  They just peel the onion and capture as many sales as they can reasonable get at each price tier to net the best earnings while growing distribution.  When they came out 4K tv's were super expensive, but over time the price decreases as they become more common and cheaper to manufacture.   No one was arguing that there was a demand problem for TV's because the prices got better.  This isn't really rocket science, and has been repeated over and over again with new tech.",

        "description": "CNBC's 'Squawk Box' discuss a recent Twitter poll from Tesla CEO Elon Musk asking users whether he should sell 10% of his shares in the company. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla shares fell by more than 4% in early morning trading Monday after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock in the electric vehicle company.\n\nShares of Tesla slipped 4.2% to $1,170 at 8:19 a.m. ET Monday, down from $1,222.09 at market close on Friday. Earlier in pre-market trade on Monday, shares fell over 7%.\n\nIt comes after Musk asked his 62.5 million Twitter followers to determine the future of a chunk of his Tesla holdings.\n\nIn a Twitter poll launched Saturday, Musk said: \u201cMuch is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. Do you support this?\u201d\n\nThe billionaire gave people the option to vote \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d and pledged to abide by the results of the poll, whichever way it went.\n\nSome 3,519,252 people responded, and 57.9% of them voted for \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMusk previously said he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his shares in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn September, Musk said at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California, that his marginal tax rate will be over 50% when his stock options expire at Tesla, and that he was already planning to sell soon.\n\n\u201cI have a bunch of options that are expiring early next year, so ... a huge block of options will sell in Q4 \u2014 because I have to or they\u2019ll expire,\u201d he said.\n\n Jefferies raised their price target for shares of Tesla from $950 to $1,400 in a note on Monday.\n\nAnalyst Philippe Houchois wrote: \u201cWithout dismissing execution risk, Tesla is getting to a position where it can balance affordability and speed, goals which are as important as profitability in Elon Musk\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTesla looks set to gain share from large OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], potentially claiming a disproportionate share of the industry profit pool in the coming 3-5 years as legacies enter the margin dilutive EV transition phase.\u201d\n\nOther current and former Tesla board members, including Robyn Denholm, Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias have also offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla stock since Oct. 28, as the company\u2019s stock soared on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nShares climbed after Tesla posted a record third quarter and car rental company Hertz announced that it was ordering 100,000 Tesla vehicles for its fleet. Musk waited for a week after Hertz made its announcement to say that Tesla had not in fact signed a contract with the company yet. Prior to that statement, he taunted investors who were short shares of Tesla on Twitter, writing: \u201cTesla Hertz shorts.\u201d\n\nSince the Hertz announcement, Tesla shares have risen by more than 30% and so has Musk\u2019s net worth.\n\nElon\u2019s tax bill\n\nNo matter the results of the Twitter poll, Musk would have likely started selling millions of shares this quarter. That\u2019s because he\u2019s facing a looming tax bill of more than $15 billion.\n\nHis options expire in August 2022 but in order to exercise them, he has to pay the income tax on the gain.\n\nSince the options are taxed as an employee benefit or compensation, they will be taxed at top ordinary-income levels, or 37% plus the 3.8% net investment tax. He will also have to pay the 13.3% top tax rate in California since the options were granted and mostly earned while he was a California tax resident.\n\nCombined, the state and federal tax rate will be 54.1%. So the total tax bill on his options, at the current price, would be $15 billion.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

If this individual does not accept a typical salary he should be taxed based on the 'mean average ' of the sum of the total tax contribution of the corporation's employees.  This is fair and provides sufficient incentive to excel.  Family who inherit any unrealized gains should be subject to the taxation laws like the rest of us.  It takes a very unique individual to build what this very small segment of people build.  Love them or hate them but they contribute more to society than they are given credit for.  I don't know what the threshold needs to be to warrant this 'exalted' status but Elon Musk and the people like him need to be acknowledged not vilified.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s trust sold about $1.2 billion in Tesla stock on Friday, according to financial filings posted Friday evening. He still holds more than 166 million shares in the company.\n\nMusk sold about $6.9 billion worth of stock in the company over the course of the week. Some of the shares were sold in part to satisfy tax obligations related to an exercise of stock options.\n\nThose sales impacted the company\u2019s share price. Tesla stock declined 15.4% for the week, marking the company\u2019s worst one-week performance in 20 months. It was also the worst week for Tesla stock ever, excluding declines in February and March 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic sent markets tumbling.\n\nTesla shares are still up around 46% year to date following a record closing price of $1,229.91 on Nov. 4, 2021.\n\nOn Nov. 6, Musk asked his more than 60 million Twitter followers to vote in an informal poll and told them their vote would determine the future of his Tesla holdings. Financial documents filed during the week show that some were slated for sale this week no matter the outcome of the poll, however.\n\nPreviously, Musk signaled that he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his options in the fourth quarter. At an appearance at the Code Conference in September, Musk said when his stock options expire at Tesla, his marginal tax rate would be over 50%.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

I was told at signing for a solar panel package that it would cost $500 to have the panels removed so contractors can replace the roof. Now that that time has come, they are trying to charge almost $4,000.....which is almost half the cost to replace the roof. They are liars and thieves. I **** never use tesla products again because you can't trust them.\n\nLarry B\r\n\r\n(1 star)\r\n11/05/2021\r\n\r\nTesla sold me an unsafe car. I have it serviced 3 times with no luck. Each time, they said it was acting according to its program. However, 10 to 20 phantom braking events in a 50 mile trip is unacceptable. It has been hitting the brakes for no apparent reason almost every time I use the adaptive cruise. I have sent them close to 100 \"bug reports\" over the last 5 months. I am tired of being a test driver and potential crash dummy for Tesla. I want to return the car under Ohio Lemon Law, but I cannot get anyone to call me back. They said that a program update might solve the problem, but I have had at least 8 updates in the last 5 months with no fix in sight. I can't believe the most valuable car company in the world can sell such unsafe vehicles. And, I can't believe the NHTSA has not shut them down somehow!!!!\n\nJian Q\r\n\r\n(1 star)\r\n11/05/2021\r\n\r\nYes, I know, you are hot, I have Tesla cars, own a lot tesla stocks, BUT YOUR SOLAR SERVICES REALLY BAD! I requested to install Tesla Solar on August, 2020, and get installed on Dec, 2020 then powered on in Dec, 2020 as well. worked smoothly until 9.25.2021, then I called to inspect the issue, at the end of OCT, 2021, the technician said the inverter was broken, need to be replaced, and no estimate time frame for the replace. all I have to do is just wait for no complain and continue to pay high elect **** while Solar is down. I\n\nTesla removed the solar panels in July 2021 so I could have my roof replaced following a hail storm. Today is November 4, 2021, and Tesla still has not replaced the panels. They are still stored in my back yard where the Tesla Maintenance people stored them. Every month I get a letter from Tesla stating a time and date for replacing the panels. Every month about 2 days before the appointment, I receive a letter from Tesla stating that they **** reschedule it for another month. In the meantime, I pay Tesla $48 monthly for the contract. And no solar during 6 hot Texas months.\n\nAmber H\r\n\r\n(1 star)\r\n11/04/2021\r\n\r\nDo not give Tesla your money! I attempted with my husband to buy solar panels for our home through Tesla. A coworker did so a few weeks later through a different company. He told me that his company said Tesla was terrible for install which I shrugged off figuring its Tesla. How could Tesla be terrible?? We quickly learned just how that was not only accurate but an understatement at that. Tesla has ignored my calls, emails, and voicemails. They have also filed for incorrect permits then minimized our complaints. We were promised many things that never came to fruition. After months of trying to get a manager involved, I FINALLY got a call from a supervisor. After again explaining everything he provided a $200 discount! That is .6% off our $32,000 job. He then told me normally they only offer a $35 gift card if that! This is after I have had to call our electric company myself to get install scheduled, spent over 3 weeks waiting for a manager call back that was supposed to occur within 72 hours, informer Tesla their first permit was filed for the wrongly sized unit, informed them the permit was issued, and spent hours on the phone to try to get this project on track. I could not be more surprised, disappointed, and aggravated with how our experience has been but it becomes more clear by the day that this is the norm for Tesla. While they may be cheaper than most, save the frustration and get solar elsewhere! I wish we would have. We still may cancel, who knows!\n\nAW\r\n\r\n(1 star)\r\n11/02/2021\r\n\r\nTesla Solar has been the most frustrating, embarrassing ******** experience I've ever dealt with in my life.

They are the most disconnected, disorganized, group of people I've witnessed. My last 7 emails to three different Tesla Solar contacts have all gone unanswered. When you call them you wait on hold for a half hour, hour, or longer, and when you get a hold of someone they have absolutely no legitimate updates or idea of what's going on. They often transfer you, where you wait in another queue, only to be told you are against talking to someone that cannot help you. It's borderline hilarious and pathetic. Biggest regret of my life was deciding to install Tesla Solar at my residence.\n\nManny P\r\n\r\n(1 star)\r\n10/29/2021\r\n\r\nHey Tesla! a car is not an extra pair of shoe customers are willing to buy, at least not for me! I pre-ordered a Tesla Model 3 by July 2021. They told me I would be getting the car within 2 -3 months! The sales agent guided me to check the website for the delivery. First delivery timeline Sep. Second Delivery timeline Oct. Third delivery timeline: end of Oct - Nov 06 Fourth delivery timeline Nov 06 - end of Nov Last update: Dec! I contacted the Tesla support team several times; I have visited the local Tesla dealer several times, I asked a straightforward question: When can I have my car? This situation is very frustrating that a car company can not commit to a firm delivery date and keep changing the delivery date without taking any accountability. this is my feeling about Tesla: Take it or leave it! we do not **** what do you want, We do not **** what do you feel, We do not **** about shifting the delivery dates\n\nJ Dominguez\r\n\r\n(1 star)\r\n10/29/2021\r\n\r\nI bought solar panels in August 2020, I was told they would come out and inspect my roof before install. Instead they came and installed the panels on my roof then told me after the installation the roof needs to be replace in 1 year. 1 year later my roof is leaking. I call their construction team to remove the panels so my roofer can install new shingles on Oct 25th, 2021 and they tell me they can't get anyone to do the install until the end of December. I can't wait that long for them to remove my panels. I also live in the northeast region where it snows in the middle of November. Also I spent 9 1/2 hours on the phone with them to get no resolution. Can't even get a supervisor on the phone. When i was making the purchase however, they had every duck in a row to answer any or my question. Now they have my money they don't even car. Not happy at all. Would never buy a Tesla product again!\n\nSung S.\r\n\r\n(1 star)\r\n10/29/2021\r\n\r\nPlaced an order on Dec 2, 2020 took months for them to come install aluminum and weather-sheeting after over a month of waiting just got a call from a project manager saying the install/complete day should be after January 4, 2022 and I expressed my frustration to him he def did not care to hear anything but saying that?s your date there?s nothing I can do for you. When I asked I?m from ny by then we will have snow and gets cold. His respond was I?m from Nevada and obviously if it?s snowing we can?t do installation but for now your date is January 4, 2022. It?s like almost no reps on the phone cares about customers.",

        "description": "Tesla has had a strong start to 2020 and, if it continues, CEO Elon Musk could be in for a big payday. Tim Higgins, reporter at the Wall Street Journal, and Bob Lutz, former vice chairman of General Motors, joins \"Squawk Box\" to discuss.\n\nTesla delivered a record 112,000 vehicles globally during the fourth quarter, significantly topping Wall Street estimates and achieving CEO Elon Musk\u2019s year-end sales goal.\n\nWall Street expected Tesla to deliver 106,000 vehicles to customers during the fourth quarter, which would have just met the company\u2019s annual delivery goal of between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles, a 45% to 65% increase from 2018.\n\nTesla said it delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles last year, an impressive 50% jump from 2018.\n\nShares of the electric-car maker surged more than 4% in morning trading to $448, a 49% rise rise over the last 12 months.\n\nTesla\u2019s deliveries are a closely watched number in the industry, providing the closest proximation to sales. The company said it counts a car as delivered \u201cif it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct.\u201d The deliveries number is a barometer for how the company is performing ahead of releasing its quarterly earnings.\n\nTesla said it delivered 92,550 Model 3 cars and 19,450 Model S and X vehicles during the fourth quarter. The company was expected to deliver 87,900 Model 3, 9,800 Model S and 9,300 Model X vehicles, according to an average of analysts surveyed by FactSet.\n\nInvestors were also watching production numbers. In the second and third quarters of 2019, Tesla delivered more cars than it produced. The production versus deliveries gap widened in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Tesla manufactured 96,155 vehicles and delivered 97,000 vehicles. In the fourth quarter, it manufactured 104,891 vehicles and delivered 112,000.\n\nThe electric-car maker said it has produced just under 1,000 cars that are ready for sale at its new factory in Shanghai. Tesla started delivering vehicles to Chinese customers late last month.\n\nTesla said it will \u201ccontinue to focus on expanding production\u201d in both the U.S. and China, where the company reports it has demonstrated production run-rate capability of greater than 3,000 units per week. That production rate, according to Tesla, excludes local battery pack production that began in late December.\n\nDaniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, called Tesla\u2019s deliveries to end the year \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201canother step in the right direction\u201d for its Fremont assembly plant in California. Soundly beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates in the quarter \u201cwas another major feather in the cap for Musk & Co.,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile part of this recent rally has been a massive short covering, it has also been driven by underlying fundamental improvement as the company\u2019s ability to impressively not just talk the talk but walk the walk has been noticed by the Street and the optimism around the story has grown markedly from the dark days seen earlier in 2019,\u201d Ives said in a note to investors Friday morning.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk made personal appearances at the company\u2019s Fremont car plant and delivery center to cheer on employees and Tesla fans who volunteered to deliver cars to customers ahead of the year-end deadline.\n\nCustomers who received their cars in 2019 qualified for an $1,875 tax credit. But if the car was ordered in 2019, and delivered in 2020, they would not qualify.\n\nTesla is now shipping its vehicles to more locations around the world than ever before, including in the U.K. and China.\n\nThis broader customer base is one reason why Tesla assured investors in the third quarter that it would hit the low end of its prior guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries for the full year. The company also wrote then: \u201cDeliveries should increase sequentially and annually, with some expected fluctuations from seasonality. We are highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\u201d\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube\n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

        "description": "The \"Squawk Box\" crew talk about several of the morning's top stories.\n\nNoticeably better quality in the new Model 3 cars helped Tesla show the biggest improvement among automakers in Consumer Reports\u2019 latest brand rankings.\n\nThe company, run by Elon Musk, jumped into the top half of auto brands ranked by the auto team at Consumer Reports, which analyzes data on major automakers and tests hundreds of vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe saw a marked improvement in reliability in both the Tesla Model 3 and the Model S,\u201d said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports. \u201cThat was enough to really improve their brand score more than any other brand in our survey.\u201d\n\nOverall, Tesla climbed eight spots to rank 11th out of 33 auto brands, according to Consumer Reports. In addition, the Consumer Reports auto team made the Model 3 a \u201cTop Pick\u201d among vehicles with a sticker price between $45,000 and $55,000.\n\nThe positive review of Tesla and the Model 3 is the latest indication the automaker is making steady progress improving the quality and reliability of its vehicles. When Tesla first began building and selling the Model 3, in 2018, there were numerous stories detailing production issues at the company\u2019s assembly plant in Fremont, California.\n\nFisher said those issues likely hurt the quality of initial versions of the Model 3 when Tesla was ramping up production of the car. \u201cThey changed the seats, they changed the glass, they changed the suspension in the first few months of production of the Tesla Model 3,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cBecause everything is changing there are new problems every time you make changes in production.\u201d\n\nFisher says Consumer Reports noticed an improvement in the Model 3 starting in the middle of last year when production at Tesla\u2019s plant stabilized. \u201cOnce they settled that down, they were able to improve the reliability,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rankings and \u201ctop picks\u201d are based on a variety of factors, including an owner satisfaction survey of Consumer Reports members who review their vehicles. In addition, the Consumer Reports auto team tests dozens of new vehicles at the firm\u2019s test track in Connecticut.\n\nThis year, the company ranks Porsche as the top auto brand, followed by Genesis and Subaru. By comparison, Consumer Reports listed Fiat as the worst brand, right behind Mitsubishi and Jeep. CNBC reached out to Fiat for a comment regarding the latest rankings.\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube\n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk sold about $1.05 billion in stock on Tuesday evening, according to financial filings posted this week. The sales were scheduled in September to exercise options that were set to expire in 2022.\n\nMusk has sold a total of $9.85 billion in Tesla stock this month, including the $6.9 billion he sold the week of Nov. 10 and another $1.9 billion he sold on Nov. 15 and Nov. 16. Some of the shares were sold in part to satisfy tax obligations related to an exercise of stock options.\n\nMusk and his trust still hold more than 169 million shares in the company.\n\nTesla shares fell 15.4% the week ended Nov. 12, marking the worst week for Tesla stock in 20 months after Musk began selling shares. Shares of Tesla were up about 1% on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMusk ran an informal Twitter poll on Nov. 6 asking his more than 60 million Twitter followers whether or not he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. The poll ultimately ended with users telling Musk to sell.\n\nBut, Musk had already indicated earlier this year he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his options in the fourth quarter. During an appearance at the Code Conference in September, he said when his stock options expire at Tesla, his marginal tax rate would be over 50%.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

        "description": "Ahead of Tesla's (TSLA) robotaxi event this Thursday, October 10, Guggenheim Securities director of automotive equity research Ronald Jewsikow joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to outline his expectations for the event as a Tesla bear. Jewsikow tells Yahoo Finance he expects \u201cit's more likely to be a sell the news event. I think there's been a lot of hype into this event. We've seen the stock move up. investor expectations are quite high in terms of the promises that are going to be made at this event. And the products that are going to be shown. \"Ultimately, there are a lot of boxes that have to be checked, and we think that a real credible path to robotaxi commercialization in the next 12 to 24 months is extremely unlikely to come out of this event.\u201d \u201cOur view towards the stock returning closer to what we think is [its] fundamental value. But I would say that a business trading at 100 times earnings, 100 times our next year's earnings, with little to no free cash flow, is really difficult to underwrite without the robotaxi,\" Jewsikow goes on to say about the EV maker, believing Tesla could refocus back to its fundamentals after this event. \"We estimate US sales were down about 5% in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And while China [region] growth was quite material in the third quarter, I guess we will see the quality of that growth once they report Q3 earnings with the gross margin line item, but it's tough to have any single catalyst from this point.\u201d Jewsikow raises concerns about Tesla\u2019s new models cannibalizing its existing share rather than capturing more of the market. \u201cWe've seen the Cybertruck grow, but it's largely been a function of cannibalizing Model S and X sales. If we just look at Tesla's sales volumes for premium vehicles, I think to see the gross margin inflection in the next six to 12 months is pretty unlikely.\u201d \n#stockmarket #stocks #news \n\nAbout Yahoo Finance:\n\nYahoo Finance provides free stock ticker data, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, comprehensive market data, advanced tools, and more information to help you manage your financial life.\n\n- Get the latest news and data at finance.yahoo.com\n\n- Download the Yahoo Finance app on Apple (https://apple.co/3Rten0R) or Android (https://bit.ly/3t8UnXO)\n\n- Follow Yahoo Finance on social:\n\nX: http://twitter.com/YahooFinance\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/yahoofinance/?hl=en\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@yahoofinance?lang=en\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/yahoofinance/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/yahoo-finance",

The stock market however is a cancer pushing a product that is basically paper. Analysts sit in offices moving paper around generating income for THEM on paper.

But this time, it\u2019s not cars or rockets. It's housing. In true Elon fashion, Tesla has introduced a game-changing $10,000 tiny house that\u2019s completely powered by solar energy. Designed for sustainable, off-grid living, this compact home is more than just a gimmick! It\u2019s part of Elon\u2019s larger vision for the future. And what\u2019s really surprising? Elon himself is living in one of these tiny homes, practicing what he preaches about living simply and sustainably. \n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 About Elon Musk Rewind\n\ud83c\udfa5 Videos about Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla and more\n\ud83c\udfa8 Written, voiced and produced by Elon Musk Rewind\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe now for more Elon Musk, SpaceX and Tesla videos\n\ud83d\udda4 Support us now and become an Elon Musk fan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZe2W7i8E5Em0sNL8p12EA/join\n\n\ud83d\udcbc Business inquiries and contact\n\u279f For business inquiries, copyright matters or other inquiries please contact us at: elonrewind@gmail.com.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Educational and documentary content\n\u279f Content Context: This video discusses unverified information and theories from various sources.

The actual builders of these homes are companies like Boxabl, which create small, modular, energy-efficient homes designed to work with Tesla\u2019s technology.\n\nThe cost of these tiny homes typically ranges from $50,000 to $100,000, depending on custom features like upgraded solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. Basic versions include solar energy solutions and can significantly reduce utility bills, though they may not eliminate them entirely. Some models, like the Boxabl Casita, are priced around $50,000 but come with additional costs for land, permits, and utility hook-ups  .\n\nAs for availability in California, these homes are available for purchase, but you should check local zoning laws to ensure tiny homes are allowed in your area .

Before agreeing to buy the company outright on April 14, he owned 73 million shares at an average price of $36.16.\n\nTwitter shares hit $51.70 on April 25 - which would have represented a $1.1 billion profit for Musk. But they've since fallen 31% to below $36 - turning that billion-dollar gain into a $40 million loss.\n\nTwitter fell 6% Tuesday as investors sold off social media and advertising stocks after Snap announced it would miss its second-quarter revenue target. It's fallen 28% in the last month and 18% so far this year.\"\n\n***\n\nThe largest online progressive news show in the world. Hosted by Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian.

Like all social media companies, the only revenue it makes is by selling ads, which in the case of Twitter isn't that much.  Tesla, which is finally making money after more than a decade of losses, still isn't that profitable.  Tesla investors are betting on the future of electric car sales which isn't a bad bet given $5/gallon gas (and rising) along with legislation in the EU pushing electric cars.  However, based on current sales, Tesla's stock is grossly overvalued.",

            "A fool and his money. Like why buy Twitter? Twitter is a toxic place and Elon Musk would not have made it better. That money could go into improving the homeless people, schools, feeding the hungry, etc. Instead he buys a crappy Social Media site.",

He has my full support as a leftist. But it seems the lines moved when he bought it. So I have no idea where I am at on the political spectrum now.  I am sure some bored shitlib will be happy to let me know. I just know I am not a conservative or a shitlib.",
            "He portrays himself as a genius all I see is an idiot with way to much money burning a hole in his pocket.  Many of his badly thought out failed ventures fail badly and should of stayed as a crazy thought in is mixed up head.  As for his fire hazard cars,(yes all cars can catch fire but electric cars are very fast in becoming an inferno and very difficult to extinguish).  The fire situation should of been sorted pre releasing any car ICE and electric.  I buy a new car every 3-4 years and that new car smell is glue based.

Rain Man 0.5  The guy that has to be the smartest person in the room when it's obvious you're not. But his one of a kind view of the universe & his inability to read that universe like most of us is a little creepy, scary. He's the worlds richest person, supposedly intellectually superior & he paid $300,000 for a no-happy ending, 7 mi. above the earth. Please, we can never allow him to develop any type of weapon.",
            "Buying Twitter never looked like a plausible move to most of the business analysts I could find discussing it. But when he paused the deal, all I heard was \"I'm suspending my campaign for...\" The one announcement you never hear is \"I'm resuming my campaign for...\"",

            "The whole Twitter Frezy aside, this just proved that you can't introduce a Wealth Tax, if Elon was taxed when Tesla stock was at $1200 then would he have got compensation when the stock dropped to $700?",

        "description": "The 'Power Lunch' team discusses Elon Musk's recent tweet calling for a breakup of Amazon.\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Thursday tweeted Thursday that he thinks it\u2019s time to break up Amazon.\n\nHis tweet came after writer Alex Berenson tweeted a screenshot showing that his upcoming book about Covid-19 doesn\u2019t meet Amazon guidelines for sale. Berenson has been a critic of the coronavirus lockdown and has suggested that the risks of serious illness or death are much lower than reported, especially for younger people.\n\n\u201cThis is insane @JeffBezos,\u201d Musk said, tagging the Amazon CEO. \u201cTime to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!\u201d\n\nAmazon said later that the book was removed in error, is being reinstated and that it has contacted Berenson.\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of government policy during the coronavirus pandemic. He has also tweeted in favor of reopening the country and during a Tesla earnings call said stay-at-home orders are fascist, among other things.\n\nMusk has a record of making strange remarks on Twitter. His latest example was on May 1, when he tweeted that Tesla stock \u201cis too high.\u201d In 2018, he said on Twitter he was going to take Tesla private when its stock price his $420 and that he had already secured funding. The SEC sued over that tweet, and both Musk and Tesla paid separate $20 million fines as part of a settlement, and Musk agreed to submit his tweets to an overseer from then on.\n\nIn July 2019, the DOJ announced an antitrust review into Big Tech. In September, the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet. Bezos is the only CEO who has expressed reservations about appearing before the committee, Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said in May.\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: \nhttps://cnb.cx/2JdMwO7 \n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

            "Hey, something that might interest you. A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well.

            "So what if Musk cuts 10% of jobs at Tesla. Those laid off workers can get jobs at MacDonalds right away. Every single MacDonalds in my area has signs they are hiring people. The economic outlook would be bad if there was record unemployment but there isn\u2019t. Unemployment is at the lowest level in decades. The economy is stronger than its ever been. All these companies are hiring. Burger King, Taco Bell, Wienerschnitzel  in and out Burger, Macy\u2019s, j c penny\u2019s. During the depression of the 1930\u2019s the economy was bad because of massive unemployment and no one hiring. With all these companies hiring no one should be unemployed. The economy now is the strongest it has ever been.",

All of them say high prices for everything? What high prices. I also know a retired city employee for the city of Los Angeles getting a $100,000 a month pension. Not a year, a month. Plus every where I drive in Los Angeles the roads are full of cars. If gas costs so much then why isn\u2019t anyone cutting down on driving?

Still, there are a lot of people working and getting jobs, look at the recent job report, so someone is doing ok or well, even in high inflationary times.  So he is laying off people, I'm not sure if that is in China or US, I bet more in China,  but isn't there demand for his high end cars?  So is laying off 6000 people a hedge, because he might not hit next quarters numbers, which would be unfortunate for the people he is laying off?

        "description": "In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called Tesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would transform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would want\u2014 affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. \n\nIn 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.\n\nOver the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit.\n\n Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a \u201chell of a ride,\u201d and he took Wall Street along with him. Here\u2019s the wild story of how Tesla started an EV revolution.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

            "My theory about the Elon. He have brilliant mind, and he is a visionary when it comes to electric cars and solar panels. \nThats positives. \nOn the shortcoming side. It is not a secret, that he was pretty timid and shy, had lots of problems with peers. That comes from something, some neglect, trauma from his childhood. When you are traumatized, you dont get attention to grow, develop. And from that comes Elons excentric, unpredictable behaviour. He is doing something unexpected, get the world attention, and go back to doing his thing. Attention he maybe lacks in his personal live. But we all need attention. This is normal human need. The thing is how we are going about to get it. If you got succes before resolving your issues, and fixing your relationships, you will use that power that comes with a success.

            "It was Biden's climate legislation that played a big part in Tesla slashing pricing to get under the caps and drive back up demand. The incredible thing for the transition is we care in month 1 if a 10 year plan.",
            "MSM anchors from FOX, CNBC, CNN to Leave-Kevin, were to call out Elon Musk(D by heart) for a drunken trumper, just 3 months ago. He obviously is not that stupid, to support the sinking MAGA supertanker. Fundamentals, revenue and profit matters, and will prevail over FAKE news. Worlds best space rockets and supercars, were not invented by a fool, or a crook like the former, but by a genious, that most losers didnt have the brains to understand and appriciate. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6",
            "Hahaha, CNBC hates having to post these Tesla facts & successes!  They're still lying about demand, they cut prices to not only increase demand but to allow US consumers to get the tax credit.  They can because their margins are 10X higher than their competitors.  Tesla is $175 right now, & in 2023, barring a hard recession, Tesla delivers over 2 million vehicles.   BUY, BUY, BUY",
            "Decreased price means increased demand. Analysts should know this.",

            "I'd stop getting caught up on margin. That's not everything. That's like saying Nordstrom is a more successful company than Walmart.",
            "Buy Tesla stocks, before they go up even higher.  10% up last night.    This will be THE investment of your lifetime.      40%, 50% per year growth is insane.     No company does that in the world.    By end of this year.     Easily 100% to 200% return if u buy them now.",
            "How is this possible when in December my rep was begging me to buy one",
            "Average, don\u2019t you know the meaning of average.  Tesla has blown it away again and all the BS your network blasted the world with is now proven to be money spinning click bate propaganda.  Wake up world CNBC is just full of it!",
            "These guys have no clue.  This was as upbeat as it\u2019s been for the last 3 years, 12 quarterly calls and some investor days.  Continued to dismiss questions about demand, hype up autonomy,\u201d and the product road map and snipe at investors by saying retails is smart and understands.  These guys look at the stock reaction and then create a narrative that fits.",
            "I don\u2019t believe Elon whatsoever. Fool me once, shame on you\u2026fool me twice... , if you get fooled you can\u2019t get fooled again.",
            "ONLY TO KICK OUT SWING & DAY TRADERS. \nI love the way they shake the market just to get rid of peanut eaters in the market before a big spike in February. Hawkish fedz will be useless lol.",
            "Is it just me or has anyone else heard any response to Tesla's price cuts from any other OEM manufacturer with the exception of Hyundai/Kia who basically said they are not lowering their prices on EVs and instead are limiting production which translates to we cannot compete with Tesla so we bow down!",
            "To the moon.",

            "these fools are nothing but short sellers",
            "Fuuuuuuuu cnbc",
            "No matter how the report comes in if you are looking for negatives you're going to find them. CNBC only sees negative when it comes to Tesla. I wonder if Tesla had a huge ad campaign that would change.",
            "Oh, you mean all the negative news we heard in the last few months was all wrong?",
            "With the repair of the batteries being almost the cost of the car looks like a no go for most basically no resale market at all your basically buying new and at 50,000 plus the counts most folks out",
            "Now ain\u2019t this more like it?\ud83e\ude78\ud83d\udc07",
            "Biden gov. tried to exclude Tesla from IRA rebates to please union lobby, Tesla cutting their prices to meet IRA requirements is gonna hurt Legacy big time.",
            "They have lots of room to play with the margins to manage demand at least.  Compare that to Ford with like a 5% margin\u2026",
            "They better improve their suspension! Model 3 Ubers Ive been in that are 60k+ miles sound like a beat up and cheap suspension. Creaks, squeals and moans like an old car. I think that is what makes them susceptible to competition, you're paying 40k plus for the battery, motors, and tech. They still cheap out on the rest of the car components because they can not get their cost down.Capital intensive business. Not many regular people can afford a 40-50k car at 6-8% APY right now.

Along with the completion of its Shanghai factory and better-than-expected fourth-quarter deliveries, shares of Tesla more than doubled since late September, trading as high as $498 in Wednesday\u2019s session.\n\nLutz, who retired in 2010 after 47 years in the auto industry, had previously said he thought Tesla was \u201cheaded for the graveyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will never make money on the Model 3 because the cost is way too high,\u201d Lutz said in September 2018. \u201cHe\u2019s got 9,000 people in that assembly plant producing less than 150,000 cars a year. The whole thing just doesn\u2019t compute.\u201d\n\nBut the situation, particularly regarding the Model 3, has dramatically changed, Lutz said Wednesday. Tesla has \u201cachieved a volume break through, with the plant in China opening and selling a lot of Model 3s,\u201d he added.\n\nFirst debuted in the summer of 2017, the Model 3 had a \u201crelatively slow start,\u201d Lutz contended. But it became the bestselling electric vehicle in the world in the first 11 months of 2019.\n\nLutz said that accelerating Model 3 sales, especially ones with bells and whistles, have been aided by its perception as a high-end alternative to cars from BMW or Mercedes-Benz. He said he believed, when factoring in additional features, a lot of Model 3s were actually selling around $55,000 to $60,000.\n\n\u201cAs long as they can keep that premium pricing, which is as I say about $33,000 over where they had originally talked about, obviously that car is going to be profitable,\u201d Lutz said.\n\nTesla had previously advertised plans for a $35,000 version of the Model 3, but the approach was significantly altered in the spring. In October, Tesla raised the price of its most affordable version of the Model 3 about $500 to $39,490.\n\nEven so, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 has actually contributed to an overall decline in the average price of electric vehicles, according to data from Cox Automotive that publication Inside EVs reported on. The average cost to buy an EV in the U.S. in September was around $56,000. One year earlier it was around $64,000, according to the Inside EVs report.\n\nLutz said he also thought Musk, who is known for his sometimes eccentric personality and bold predictions, has moderated.\n\n\u201cHe has been quite adept,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cThe encouraging thing to me about Tesla is from Elon there is less talk, less bluster ... he is focusing on the business, focusing on the product and focusing on cost control.\u201d\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube\n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

            "The Big Three (boy is that moniker old, right) spends upwards of $2 billion EACH  annually to advertise their products.  Tesla spends squat and still sells every car it manufactures.  That's not a \"normal\" business model so Lusk IS STILL WRONG ABOUT TESLA even when he's trying to be complimentary.",

Now he's forced to accept Tesla's success and says Tesla's business model has changed. Maybe Tesla's business model was the right one all along and Lutz is just trying to explain away his mistakes.",
            "Musk not running Tesla in a way that Lutz calls \"normal\" is the reason for Tesla's massive success now and for why Lutz' former employer is now way behind Tesla where it comes to EVs. Musk chose to accept the upfront costs that are required for innovation and now has massive sales success because he has a superior product. Lutz called the massive investments foolish, but they are now proven to have been the right choice.",
            "The reason that Lutz is now more positive about Tesla is not because Tesla was making mistakes in the past, but because Lutz is finally starting to see that Tesla's approach is working. Tesla's strategy was based on a lot of upfront investments in innovation, which Lutz referred to as wasting money. Now, Tesla is way ahead of the competition and is massively outselling them, proving Lutz' predictions wrong. The only thing Lutz can do now is trying to explain away his massive mistakes.",
            "Lutz' main point is that Tesla now produce the model 3 efficiently.\nJust a simple fact: making a new product is always inefficient initially, especially if it is very innovative. Lutz was wrong about Tesla all the time until now and he's just trying to explain away his mistakes now that his negative views have been shown to be idiotic.",
            "Lutz has been wrong about Tesla all the time until now and he's just trying to explain away his mistakes.",
            "I don't see why Lutz is treated as an expert here. He has constantly been dismissive about Tesla until now and been proven wrong all the time.\nHe said Tesla would go bankrupt andhe said their products have no advantage over the competition.\nTesla is now doing better than ever and both experts like Sandy Munro and the car buyers who vote with their feet say Teslas are way better.\nIf Lutz made such fundamental mistakes, he obviously isn't an expert.",

            "The idea that Tesla wasn\u2019t run as a \u201c normal business \u201c under Elon for the last 5 years is just an idiotic take. The media and haters created the idea of chaos. Now that they are proven wrong they need to feel like they were still correct for all those years by claiming that Elon finally listened to them and got serious. Fuck off.",

            "I\u2019d own a car for a million miles...",

            "No one wants to own a car for a million miles. Lol. The million mile battery supports autonomous ride hailing. Many miles needed per car for that.",
            "Honestly, everything Elon Musk said during the meeting was very promising if anything. He did highlight the challenges but that shows me that he's being realistic. I don't think he's ever not been realistic. Y'all can keep doubting and bring the stock down, I'll keep buying at these at lows.",
            "This guy is completely clueless! Do your homework before you talk.   So disappointing to see the misinformation being spread by some one probably has never been inside of a Tesla.",
            "Yahoo is idiot. They never get it with Tesla",
            "Here is a thought, the Tweet from Elon on the previous day makes me think that he doesn't want the event to cause too much hype on the stock price, Tesla just sold $5 billion worth of stock, the company probably would suffer more from highly volatile stock because many employees' pay is tied to it. There is a good possibility that they intentionally downplayed the event to keep things stable. Tesla is going to use any announcement to the best advantage for the company rather than wallstreet. Even if they have some significant news, now they will be more careful on timing of announcing it.",
            "Nice",
            "This guy has no clue what he\u2019s talking about. I wonder what his qualifications and in-depth research he has done to come to the conclusion that Tesla\u2019s self driving technology is not advanced as Tesla says??? Tell me what other auto manufacturer or software company is nearly close to what Tesla has on the road today??? This guy is a joke!",
            "Open source their battery technology? That is stupid. They spent millions for this and their rivals will benefit and take potential profits from them.",
            "now it is time to buy tesla stock, since all the parasite day traders are gone",
            "Focus of the presentation wasn't even the million mile battery. It was eco sustainability and affordable ev",
            "Elon need to tweet more discouraging tweets so  people can buy more Tesla stocks",
            "It takes more than a hour to charge the car on the miles.",
            "Yes. I do.",

            "Bitcoin <will go to infinity against US dollar for the same reason gold and silver will go to infinity against US dollar because is dollar is shit and headed to hyperinflation and at that point no one will sell either for dollars so I can say 1 btc will be more the 1trillion because like Zimbabwe who printed trillion dollar bills the dollar will be worthless. I just sold my shib last night. I feel it is time to move on to the top coins only and let the dust settle. Too much uncertainty with \"regulations\" worldwide going on and governments going broke are going to try and tax the crap out of crypto. India is a classic example. I will build my reserves in btc, eth and etc and see how things develop. All of the market uncertainty these last couple of years would have been extremely stressful without your educational videos. Thank you for helping me understand the \"why\" behind all of the crazy headlines. Your content has been a God send these last couple of years. Know that all of your effort is having a positive impact. Thank you!! Bitcoin price shows a consolidation pattern, which indicates that an upswing is on its way. Ethereum and Ripple are both showing optimistic outlooks that indicate gains in the next few days. when you do not learn any lesson from your previous loses, you will keep losing your funds in the money market. I think we really need more experts in this field to give newbies a sense of how the community works. I was able to easily increase my portfolio just trading with Thomas Fuller\u2019s daily signals trading! 1 BTC to 4 BTC.

It will only secure product for HIMSELF at his own price. It won't affect Demand or the Price of Lithium.  In fact, it could go even higher for all others as he removes Product from the Marketplace solely for Tesla.  Today's Miners, upcoming and existing, cannot address Supply for at least 5 years and you can't bring on new Mining for at least 5 to 10 years, thanks to Permitting and Protests.  Good luck, Elon.

            "Elon knows that they are going to lose money mining for lithium. The Chinese dominate lithium production and will not allow Tesla access to it. The Chinese are about to expand aggressively in Europe and the US and will support Chinese EV companies first.Second, California's lithium rich Salton sea will be  dominated by EV battery manufacturers and other EV manufacturers and it doesn't include Tesla.  Third, Mexico just nationalized it's lithium and and other minerals and will most likely sell it to auto companies already manufacturing there. This includes Hyundai,  Kia, GM, Ford, and others. Tesla isn't one of them. Fourth, lithium produced in Latin America is mostly financed and purchased by China. But no one talks about it. Elon better move fast if he wants to mine his own lithium.",

Not only is he at the cutting edge of 21st-century technology. But, as of this video, he is also the richest man in the world, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaire List. \nElon owns approximately 48% of Space X. A company revolutionizing the commercial space industry and leading the charge in making human beings a multi-planetary species. \nHe also owns 23% of Tesla Motors. A company that probably needs no introduction. In the last decade, Musk and Tesla have come to dominate the Electric Car market. \n\nIn the last year alone, Tesla\u2019s Market Capitalization has grown from US$ 100 Billion in Jan 2020, to US$ 1.12 Trillion as of 30th October 2021! \nThis makes Tesla Motors, the largest automaker in the world in terms of valuation. Surpassing legacy companies like Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, and BMW combined!\n\nThis made us think, what does Elon Musk have to say about his competitors and the future of the EV market?\n\nStick around as we take a look at some of Tesla\u2019s main competitors and Musk\u2019s opinion about them.",

However given how little progress the rest of the world is doing and how much they are charging for it (no pun intended) it's got my attention as my next possible car after the updated looks. No I don't want Chinese car to add to their economy.",

            "Musk went all over the world for years hat in hand, trying to involve these knuckleheads. \n\nThe mission was renewable clean energy asap. He\u2019s still on the job. What are the other mega rich CEOs spending their money on? Gold plated toilets? Tigers in their back yard? Artisan level beards? Lol \n\nThe man is trying to settle MARS. He needs to make all the money he can. Normally this would make a person nervous, but I\u2019m tired of seeing our hard earned money get sucked down a hole in the Caymans. $&@? YEAH man, I wanna go to Mars! How can I help? Buy a 9 second/200+ mile an hour Hot Rod? Put solar on my house? Or maybe just a little electric car to get to work in? Alrighty.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how hardcore Tesla is. It\u2019s not only Elon. You can\u2019t do all this with only one genius. You can\u2019t just throw money at something and have it work. It takes the right DNA, purpose, loyalty and drive by everyone involved to pull this off! \n\nHey I know it\u2019s corny but \u201cFanboy\u201d insults are over man. All the \u201ccool kids\u201d stood on the sidelines yawning for too long. Now look at \u2018em running. I feel like my nerd buddies and me caught the bus and we\u2019re watching all the jerk bullies kack and gag running after us!

            "Crazy idea: tesla could look to permanently break even on model 2 and maybe only a small profit on other models. In the not too distant future they could make all their money on FSD software as it improves",

Higher loan rates and higher unemployment isn\u2019t going to help. I believe all auto sales from ice and ev will tank. 2024/25 might be better years",

            "He has an old product line aesthetically huge additional production capacity and a window where the old car companies are at a huge disadvantage as they have ICE sunk costs and redundant dealer networks,  this is his opportunity to eliminate the potential of the competition whilst they are at a huge disadvantage. The greatest risk to Tesla is the sale of its  Vapour Wear which is a premium market item whose uptake will collapse as it doesn't work and remains a unfulfilled promise ....I spoke to an agent in the UK who specialises in electric car sales made outside the normal dealer networks and she said that if you are going to own the car for 4 years IE on a lease it would be insane to buy the self driving option as it didn't work,  when Tesla sold its cars to luxury buyers many people want all the options , budget buyers don't also manufacturing giants like Nissan give self driving standard in its newest high end models already. Conclusion Tesla margins will collapse and its best to hide it in a price war which will compensate cash flow by higher volumes and maximal capacity utilisation whilst maximising the government handouts which is Elons key strategy for all his businesses...",

            "Musk isn't lowering prices to knock out EV competition.  I believe he's driving nails into the coffin of ICE vehicles.  EVs are on par with ICE and will soon be cheaper.  We're going to see the dominos start falling and those dominoes are legacy auto makers.  Japan is going to go through something similar to what US automakers went through in the 70's when Japanese autos were introduced to the US market.",
            "That's not a  strategy. It's insanity.",
            "Tesla is aiming for Toyota. After Toyotas change of CEO and eventual shift to EVs this year, Tesla now will rush their marketshare before Toyota is able to scale its EV production and break even on its BEV business. Exciting times indeed.",

            "I'm sure, instead of a break-even strategy, that they would choose little profit.",
            "Price-wise, sucks if you bought a Model Y one year ago. Being amongst the first adopters can be expensive.",
            "Meanwhile the share price plummets\u2026.SMH.  People just don\u2019t get tesla and Elon\u2019s plan.  They just want constant profit and don\u2019t care about R&D and investments in infrastructure that will fuel continued exponential growth",
            "Good to see the Fanboy early adopter sector of the EV market is drying up somewhat and now prices are coming down to capture some of the real market. Tricky for Tesla to able to keep profits going and maintain volume in order to reduce prices to catch the lower price end of the market at the same time.",

            "Musk had no option but to reduce prices but unlike his US  competitors he is in the position to so.And on the world stage the major competitors will be the big 3 Chinese brands.The Chinese manufactures will be the world leaders in those markets not protected by tariffs",

Among those four types of fire accidents, excluding 7 accidents with unknown causes, 31 occurred while parked, 22 occurred during charging (including fires at charging piles), 20 occurred during driving, and 6 occurred after a collision with other objects. 38.5% of fire accidents occurred in a static state, and 27.5% of fire accidents occurred in a charging state, according to the Beijing Institute of Technology.",
            "Another great video. I'm all for it if it actually materializes. Elon talks a lot, actions speak louder than words.",
            "Elon dropped the prices because of 3 big reasons!  they are going to release an update to model 3 and model Y interior and exterior look in q1 of 2024 i think - plus they prefer more growth vs. A bit more profit so that more people can upgrade and buy the FSD subscription package.  The strategy works also to ward off competitors looking to undercut tesla prices!  Genius! I will be buying more tesla shares!",
            "Like you Sam but you are a sucker for Elon. When has he ever executed\u2026Cybertruck ???\nThe factory won\u2019t be ready for 2 years, then another year to ramp up.\nBy the way this is a great excuse for declining margins. Tesla is loosing market share in China BIG. \nIn 3 years there will be many lower cost EVs. Ha ha autonomy\u2026you still buying this junk. Tesla\nIs being investigated by US. They made bad call in not using LiDAR. How don\u2019t care if their cameras are higher resolution but how does it penetrate FOG. LiDAR does.\nTry to stay objective Sam, rather than a Tesla fan.

Because all they can do is cherry pick to make a case in a situation they have no point to make just to get views and clicks and look better using someone elses fame to do so",

Its not on elon or anyone for promoting. Its still a decision each individual has to make on there own. Elon nor anyone else forced anyone to purchase outside there will. People need to acknowledge and face there own mistakes, not blame others for there own personal failure. Its like purchasing a product because its cheaper so you think your getting a discount but when you get it, its made with cheap materials and is only a counterfeit stolen design from china that breaks in a week, and then sueing for it when all you had to do is research a little and see it wasnt on the official site of the products designer and just another shop taking peoples money for someone elses work. Except in elons case, it was far less of an issue because he didnt sell anything, he just tweeted something. If you spend your life saving because of a tweet, you might just deserve to lose. You cant sue casinos for you losing a bet, and investing is just as much a gamble. People need to quit making any reason they can to not take blame for actions they made under there own decision to.

Elon Musk Reveals 250.000 Miles Range In 18 Months! Hi, Welcome to Tesla Car World! You may not know this, but Elon Musk often refers to Semi Trucks as Tesla's ultimate money-saving machine. But Why? We found that if a diesel truck drives an average of 150,000 miles per year, the fuel cost is around $75,000. But with the Tesla Semi, drivers only spend between $20,000 and $30,000, saving between $46,000 and $53,000 annually \u2014 that's a 60% to 70% reduction! Incredible, right? PepsiCo drivers have even admitted they don\u2019t want to go back to diesel trucks after getting used to the Semi. And now, Tesla has just launched the new Sleeper Cab version, along with a ton of newly released performance data. Dive in and explore it all right now!\n\nNEW Tesla Semi Sleeper Cab Version Launched! Elon Musk Reveals 250.000 Miles Range In 18 Months! You might be wondering, if the Semi Truck is such a good vehicle, why doesn't Tesla produce it in mass volume?\nBut you know , among all Tesla EV models, Semi Truck is perhaps Tesla's most challenging vehicle. It\u2019s no coincidence that the number of electric trucks has barely increased over the years. You know, the main reason is that Tesla has not yet established an automated electric truck production line at its Nevada factory.\n\nNEW Tesla Semi Sleeper Cab Version Launched! Elon Musk Reveals 250.000 Miles Range In 18 Months! The production of the Semi is still mostly done manually. Moreover, the scale of Semi production is also limited. As you know, the dimension of these big rigs requires a large facility, and Giga Nevada is not sufficient to meet the demand as this factory also has to prioritize battery cell production. This makes the production process slower and more complicated.\n===\n#888999evs #teslacarworld #teslacar #888999 #semitruck #teslasemi \nsubcribe: https://bit.ly/3i7gILj",

        "description": "CNBC's Jim Cramer explains what factors he thinks are contributing to Tesla outperforming its competitors. Subscribe to CNBC PRO for access to investor and analyst insights: https://cnb.cx/2Vtntx6 \n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer praised Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Thursday for building a company that promises to be much more than just electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cThis man is selling technology, and he\u2019s talking about fully assisted and then he\u2019s talking about driverless. He\u2019s thinking so much bigger,\u201d Cramer said on \u201cSquawk on the Street.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a big thinker. He makes us look like Lilliputians.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMad Money\u201d host\u2019s comments came one day after Tesla reported its fourth consecutive quarter of profitability, clearing the way to be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500 index.\n\nShares of Tesla, which have soared over 280% this year alone, were up and down Thursday, trading around $1,620 each. The stock hit an all-time of $1,794.99 last week.\n\nWhile emphasizing that Tesla\u2019s future is about more than just the cars it builds, Cramer said the company stands out because it\u2019s delivering what its legacy automaker rivals can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWhen you have demand when the other guys are closing plants because they don\u2019t have demand, what it says is you\u2019re not selling what they\u2019re selling,\u201d said Cramer, who had been a skeptic of Musk and Tesla. \u201cYou\u2019re making something entirely different from what they\u2019re making.\u201d \n\nTesla\u2019s renewable energy business also distinguishes it, Cramer said. Its energy storage business Megapack just turned in its first quarterly profit. Tesla also reported that solar roof installations tripled in the second quarter from the first quarter. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got this whole thing going on with solar and with energy that we don\u2019t talk about enough,\u201d Cramer said, dismissing criticism that Tesla\u2019s revenue relies too much on the sale of regulatory carbon-emissions credits to other automakers.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, the venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, told CNBC earlier Thursday that Tesla\u2019s renewable energy component could make it worth trillions. As of Thursday, Tesla\u2019s stock market value was nearly $300 billion. \n\n\u201cIt is the leading hedge when it comes to electrification and decarbonization. This is no longer about cars, that\u2019s the first wave of growth,\u201d Palihapitiya said on \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone is on the Tesla bandwagon.\n\nMike Jackson, CEO of car dealer giant AutoNation, said in a separate \u201cSquawk Box\u201d interview, \u201cThe stock price is insane. The valuation is insane.\u201d\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

See Tesla's implementation of IDRA's \"gigapresses,\" which is a far superior chassis manufacturing technology, compared to existing OEM manufacturing techniques. Gigapresses will also lower manufacturing costs dramatically. And dealerships are an albatross around the necks of existing OEMs. Regarding Elon's leadership and \"getting a real board,\" Elon's strong leadership is what has taken Tesla to a $600 billion valuation. Tesla continues to operate like a start up, making large investments and taking risks. Almost all have paid off. Compare this to ICE executives who have been focused on quarterly earnings, while falling farther and farther behind Tesla. Tesla is 3-5 years ahead in battery and manufacturing technology, and light years ahead in FSD development. No one will be able to catch them there, and a robotaxi fleet will be an enormous profit center for Tesla, while shrinking the demand for non-Tesla EVs. The writing is on the wall. Most will face bankruptcy some time in this decade.",

        "description": "For a decade, Elon Musk has championed the idea that one day Tesla cars will drive themselves as robotaxis. On October 10, the company plans to reveal a \u201cdedicated robotaxi\u201d design at an invitation-only event in Los Angeles.\n\nDespite years of bold predictions and missed deadlines, fans of the company are holding out hope that Musk will finally deliver. Regardless of what the company showcases at its robotaxi day, experts are skeptical of the company\u2019s strategy, citing its Auotpilot and Full Self-Driving technology as a barometer for Tesla\u2019s progress, or lack thereof.\n\nWhile Tesla has been developing its autonomous vehicles, competitors like Google-owned Waymo and Chinese companies like Pony.ai and Baidu have already launched commercial robotaxi services.\n\nWith U.S. EV sales growth slowing, there\u2019s a lot riding on Tesla\u2019s potential pivot to autonomy. CNBC explores whether the company is ready for robotaxis and if Musk\u2019s vision for driverless Teslas will become a reality anytime soon.\n\nCorrection:\n2:41 The event date is mislabeled. The correct event is the Tesla Annual Shareholder Meeting, which occurred on June 13, 2024.\n\nChapters:\n3:18 Ch 1 - Tesla\u2019s vision for autonomy\n6:33 Ch 2 - Full self-driving\n10:13 Ch 3 - Realizing the robotaxi\n15:34 Ch 4 - Sizing up the robotaxi competition\n\nProduced and Shot by: Andrew Evers\nAdditional Reporting: Lora Kolodny\nEdited by: Andrew Evers, Erin Black\nSupervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt\nAdditional Camera: Katie Tarasov, Lisa Setyon\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\nNarration: Robert Ferris\nAdditional Footage: Cruise, Getty Images, Tesla, Waymo, Zoox\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

            "like it or not on how they move with it, Tesla's approach to self driving has been the most promising. There are others like super cruise, Rivian's auto cruise, Waymo, etc that run better and smoother. But the major difference is those take a manually mapped approach. Roads that aren't mapped are not included. Its just simply refuses to work if the mapped roads end. This approach is more fail proof but fails to adapt to live environments the way I've seen V12 FSD handle. FSD isn't perfect or the smoothest but I never had a road that FSD simply refused to run. It seemed like it always at least knew what and where it was and what it could potentially do if it was suddenly handed controls. Similar to what a teenage driver might behave like. Slightly jerky and a little second guessy but still performs as needed. With updates, this \"teenage driver\" has gotten better and is more so a \"average driver\" running the V12 neural based base.",

Autonomous vehicles are those that enable taxi and delivery companies to operate without having to pay drivers' wages. This massive saving would make the technology incredibly valuable. Tesla does not have autonomous vehicles. If they did, they would be selling them or operating them commercially.

In my opinion, Robotaxi will be a long haul, since the current ones like Waymo cost more than getting an uber.",
            "The graph 9:38  showing crashes related to self driving is telling of Teslas advantage over other car manufacturers.. Tesla gamble it's customers and use them like beta users. Regular car manufacturers have much higher safety standards which makes them slower than tesla.",

            "The so-called experts in this video have clearly not been following FSD developments in 2024. In late 2023, Tesla completely revised the method used to train the FSD software. They threw out 300,000 pages of computer code written by a team of engineers and began retraining the software using neural nets and machine learning. The massive computer cluster that does this work in being fed millions of video clips from Tesla's customer vehicle fleet. FSD is learning how to drive the same way we humans do: using vision.\n\n These fundamental changes were released to the public in the spring of 2024 with the release of FSD Version 12. Everyone who is using the current version of FSD (version 12.5.4) is astounded by the difference. It actually feels as if a human is driving the vehicle, and FSD is able to make smart decisions in complex traffic situations, and it keeps getting smarter with each software update. 2023 and 2024 Teslas come standard with a new V4 high-resolution camera suite and a faster onboard inference computer, although earlier V3 equipped Teslas can use the current FSD software.\n\nThis is a fundamentally different approach than Waymo, which uses hard coding and a walled-garden approach. Their vehicles can only operate on specific streets that they are hard-coded for, whereas Teslas with FSD can self-drive nearly anywhere. Waymo's business model will fail because their sensor-laden vehicles are too expensive to be profitable on a large scale. They are currently operating in only three cities.\n\nElon Musk has long been overly optimistic when it comes to development timelines, but in the end, Tesla does deliver. That's happened over and over. FSD is already a safer driver than most human drivers, and it continues to learn.",
            "Yeah well they said these things like tesla couldn't be successful as an EV company and here we are. Of course they must protect their investors and instil doubt into consumers. FSD is great and forces the market to shift in attempt to keep up. But we all know there is no real competitor here. Tesla is leagues ahead.",

The stock rose about 3% after hours as the company beat expectations on EPS and revenue, and reported its fifth consecutive quarter of profit. Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of GLJ Research, joins \"Squawk Box\" to discuss. Subscribe to CNBC PRO for access to investor and analyst insights on Tesla and more: https://cnb.cx/2BT2E7y\n\nElon Musk\u2019s electric car and renewable energy company, Tesla, reported third-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday. The stock was up 5% in premarket trading Thursday as the company beat expectations on EPS and revenue, and reported its fifth consecutive quarter of profit.\n\nHere is how Tesla performed versus analyst expectations:\n\nEarnings per share (adjusted): 76 cents vs 57 cents, per Refinitiv\nRevenue: $8.77 billion vs $8.36 billion, per Refinitiv\nNet income (GAAP): $331 million vs $394 million, per Refinitiv\nThe company already reported that it delivered 139,300 vehicles during the quarter, a new record for Tesla.\n\nAutomotive revenue comprised $7.6 billion, about 91% of the total for the quarter. Automotive gross margins, excluding regulatory credits, rose from 18.7% to 23.7% sequentially. Tesla raked in $397 million in regulatory credits during the quarter nearly doubling the amount it made from these \u201cgreen\u201d credits year-over-year.\n\nOperating expenses jumped 33% from last quarter to $1.25 billion, as Tesla embarked on building new factories in Austin, Texas and Brandenburg, Germany, among other things.\n\nMusk talked about production timelines for those factories in the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cI should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year but because of the exponential nature of the spool up of manufacturing plants especially one with new technology, we\u2019ll start off very slow at first and then become very large.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned investors that it could take 12 to 24 months even to hit full capacity at these new factories after they begin operations. Tesla previously planned to start production at the Berlin factory in July 2021.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Probably at least 15% of the small shareholders will stay with tesla cause they trust musk and tesla. Now do the math! 70 Billion is the company worth minus 65% for the people who will stay on and wont sell their shares when tesla goes private.  That means musk would have to pay max 35% of 70 Billiion Dollars to make tesla a private company! Musjk needs about 25 Billion Dollars to make tesla private.

            "< I totally agree with what you are saying....The fact is, BTC remains the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now are if this is the right time to invest? before jumping to a conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days, the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can't tell if it is going bearish or bullish. While others still continue to trade without the fear of making losses, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me, I started with 3 BTC and I have accumulated over 9 BTC in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Carl Roberts. Say hello to Roberts today.",

There is lots of information on Musk, 'his' various companies,  business dealings, associates etc. One chapter is even devoted to Musk: 'The Musk Myth'.  David has been censored from most/or all mainstream, and, even, alternative media sources. He is a former footballer and sports broadcaster (British)  who wrote over 20 books (self-published since the mid-1990s) and has spoken in more than 25 countries--he is now banned from entering most of those countries now.  I wonder what it is that would cause so many platforms and so many countries to censor and ban him?"

The divergences caused by the \u201cagentur\u201d (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to DESTROY the other governments and in order to WEAKEN the religions.\n\nThe Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War, International COMMUNISM must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the FINAL social cataclysm.\n\nThe Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the \u201cagentur\u201d of the \u201cIlluminati\u201d between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam and political Zionism mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion\u2026\n\nWe shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists (Russia, China) and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.\n\n(Caught being planned. See link below.)\nhttps://youtu.be/dEMG5I_56Q4\n\nThen everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure DOCTRINE OF LUCIFER, brought finally out in the PUBLIC view.\n\nThis manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both CONQUERED and EXTERMINATED at the same time.\u201d\u00a0 - Albert Pike (100% accurate predicting ALL 3 World Wars)\n\nQuotes By Albert Pike from his book:\n\n\"Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, CONCEALS its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses FALSE explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to MISLEAD those who deserve only to be misled; to CONCEAL the Truth, which it calls Light from them and to draw them AWAY from it.\"\n\nFictions are necessary for the people, and the Truth becomes deadly to those who are not strong enough to contemplate it in all its brilliance. In fact, what can there be in common between the vile multitude and sublime wisdom? The Truth must be kept SECRET, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason.\"\n\n\"That which we must say to the crowd is, we worship a god, but it is the god one adores without superstition. To you sovereign grand inspector general, we say this and you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees - the Masonic religion should be by all of us initiates of the HIGH degrees, maintained in the purity of the luciferian doctrine. Yes, lucifer is god!\" - Albert Pike (Was a Lawyer, writer, Confederate General and a 33 degree Freemason/Satanic Illuminati.)\n\n\u00a0- Albert Pike published this in a book \"Morals & Dogma\" in 1871.

In fact, it predicted a similar cataclysmic fate for the UK, Australia, Germany, Japan, Denmark, and other US allies. For example, according to Deagel, the population of France will increase from 67 million inhabitants in 2017 to 39 million in 2025, that of England will increase from 66 million to 15 million, that of Australia from 23 million to 15 million. , that of Germany from 81 million to 28 million, while the population of Canada will grow from 36 million in 2017 to 26 million in 2025.

Neglect to have a separation from the court in that, the job of finding evidence to convict is with the court. So a dirty people \ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0fwould have someone confess to a crime, tell them where, when, who,. Then those cops will say they're good\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f detectives when the information they gathered wasn't constitutionally allowed. It says a person can't self incriminate. Which is how it leads to the court saying the burden of proof rests with\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f courts. They rephrase a part of the constitution.

They will get an attitude. Listen this the sauce.  If they force you to answer, any questions by force...i think you're on your way to being\ud83e\udee0 able to get your charges dropped...given you didn't do something on camera. N even if you did.\ud83e\udee0 Let's say yiure scared, okay boom.

Whatelse?\nProtect ya mindset around these afsers. \ud83e\udee0\n    If you're given anything to sign, don't. Next typically they have\ud83e\udee0 gear that weighs them down, so of you are going to engage them physically that's the risk of your life. They may decide to take a gun out instead of a laser similar to how they did my buddy in Charlotte,NC. So if you run it's a charge if they\ud83e\udee0 catch you n pair the crime to you.

I've heard of you attack\ud83e\udee0 the dog, it's a charge on a please afser,. If your a minority assume they have backup on the way in your blindspot or behind you. What else. When seeking an attorney after you deciding to put your fingers behind your back. Idk. You may decide a minority, yet idk. \ud83e\udee0Who do they idolize \ud83e\udee0in your state. If you don't hear negative stories about your people go with the same race. If yiu hear people being mistreated in stores, restaurants etc, choose the best wheet attorney you mesh with.

            "My prediction (from the perspective of a relatively experienced digital media agency buyer for a big brand) for Twitter:\n\n-Revenue decline of around 50-60% this quarter and next (this is just based on what I know to be happening at most major media agencies around the world)\n-Profits go insanely negative this quarter as redundancies are paid out, but don't look so bad two quarters from now due to the incredibly lean staff costs\n-Two quarters from now I wouldn't be surprised if Twitter becomes slightly profitable. Because the drop in costs should far outstrip the drop in revenue (though revenue should not rebound for two quarters).\n-I don't think revenue from verified users will go anywhere for a while. It won't make a dent in the drop in advertiser revenue. Every Elon defender I've seen who talks about the revenue from verified users....their conversion rates are super optimistic.\n\nAfter half a year it's a toss up. If Twitter becomes nothing but a right wing cesspool, either due to moderation policy changes, or the lack of staff to enforce existing moderation policies, then it might spiral continually downwards. \n\nIf however the integrity of the ad platform can be assured, and the content isn't a complete cesspool but just a normal level of internet bad, then there's a future for the company (but at a much lower revenue and valuation than before). Advertisers need consistency. They can deal with toxicity (think about how much extremism and bad PR are on Youtube/Meta/Newscorp etc. and those all print money from ad revenue) but they can't deal with uncertainty and inconsistency. Personally most buyers and brands I know are looking to revisit the issue in about 1-2 quarters from now and I expect most other advertisers will be working around that timeline.\n\nNot that we can ever get this verified because it's not going to be a public company for the foreseeable future.",

But the catch is, substantial code changes, particularly those that might affect privacy like user verification/impersonation, have to go through review and be passed by someone in Irish Twitter checking to make sure they don't run afoul of Irish law. And if they don'r, the company lays itself open to the laws and FINES of every EU member state, which it looks like Musk may have done. \n\nAgain, can he just barge in, violate whatever laws he wants as Twitter's CEO, and then leave Twitter with all the financial and legal liability and get away with it?\n\nI stress that I am not an expert and may not be understanding the above situations, which may be playing out differently.

Elon Musk is just flexing his financial muscles because he\u2019s mad about something, HE'S A SPOILED ASS RICH BOY. What's the point because if he wants a platform like twitter, he could build one from scratch, and quite frankly that would probably be less expensive & he could definitely drive people to his platform; so WHAT'S THE POINT, THE SPOILED ASS RICH BOY WANTING MORE ATTENTION, SO HE HAS TO START A FIRE SOMEWHERE?  WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON? I guess it may not be long before Elon runs for political office too & ignorant poor & middle-class people somehow would believe because he's rich he'll know how to manage our collective business & that's what his true intentions are, so they'll vote for him, looking over how he most often, demonstrates his selfish money power driven, unapologetic, no one knows more than him, always right character & his tendency to say whatever he has to in hopes of convincing people to believe a very cunning & false representation of themselves.",

I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Nathan Hart I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor Nathan Hart who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market....."

As far as I remembered you either work part time or full time 40 hrs a week. Thirdly, is Elon Musk forcing you to work for him? Go find another job.",

The complete integration of information, trust, relevant less annoying ads, and a payments platform, is helping us understand the possible long possibilities of such a platform. Your explanation of the long time horizon puts it in clearer focus, and away from the current short term thinking of many businesses and individuals.",
            "A platform where the content is based on truth is not what we have today.  And, the approach that we will hire thousands of people to monitor accounts and what is posted always seemed to be pure nonsense.  Can it be fixed? yes.  It needs a foundation for truth that software can utilize to vet new content.  Tight unique identification of users is a start. Blockchain is useful for after-the-fact audit but it can't prevent lies from being published. An Ontological foundation of facts that are \"basic truths\" can change the game for content verification by applying the basic facts (truths) concurrent with application of digitized rules and software.  Without the architectural foundation, success (a high level of trust) is not possible.",

Source accounts will also need a star rating to allow users to filter out low star sources if they want.  Key will be allowing users to specify the degree of risk of getting false or negative info.

            "To me the fact, that starlink is mentioned so much is a bit confusing, because there already is a world wide internet infrastructure and this will provide it to a few million more people in remote places.\n\nSo you basically think it would become like facebook / weChat today, but while keeping trust, by maybe don't save as much user data? If so, how could one still do extremely targeted adds? (I am really asking, don't understand how targeting could otherwise work) Or what would be the difference to facebook? Just sincerely curious, no hate :)",

            "\"Only limit is code\" = no limit, especially using AI to tackle the coding... as always your content is very insightful",

            "Hey Farzad I'm a big fan!",
            "Twitter might become our communication platform. But what about news? Here's my idea.\n\nI don't like to subscribe to single newspapers. A better idea would be to subscribe to a bounce of them, and they share my fee according to how I utilize them. The only problem with that is it encourages clickbait \"jounalism\". So, the concept needs work.\n\nBut newspapers are actually not the right idea!\n\nMy current idea is a site (or many of them) where an AI pulls together news from all over the world, and most importantly, verifies the stories to its best ability, so it filters out most of the junk!\n\nThen, of course, I must be able to configure my profile of current interests. And that in a pretty vague language, so I don't filter out everything I don't yet know I want.\n\nThis concept can, perhaps (certainly?), be corrupted into something akin to what we have now: sites where a single slanted view is all you get, and that by human cooperation.\nBut I trust my ability of choosing the right AI to listen to.\nI just want the opportunity to choose!\n\nWhat I really need is the reduction of noise!",
            "You are missing that the Twitter super app is what we will utilize to remotely manage our own fleet of robots.\n\nIn our future world there isn't just humans!",

            "People overlook energy, which will be at least as big as cars by the end of the decade. Demand is surging with current energy prices \u00e1nd government pressure to move to durable energy sources.",
            "It's wrong thinking that robots will replace human work!\n\nThink of it like this: did computers replace us humans?\nBut they do a lot of our work, don't they?\n\nIt's the same with robots. We will use robots to work more effectively. Instead of ourself doing repetitive work, we will do it by managing robots.\n\nThere's no limit to the amount of work that need to be done, or can be done.\n\nAs a retiered software engineer, I think my old work can be made smarter.\nToday, we can utilize AI to paint a picture, a piece of art, from a few vague instructions. How about it designing a user interface to your application. And then continue with implementing the fuctionality from your vague instructions.\nThat's the new kind of programming!\n\nBut still not really the future. Do we really need those old computer applicatins when we can ask a robot to do things for us.\n\nThat's our new kind of work: asking robots to do things for us.",
            "Are you pitching to be the next Twitter CEO?",
            "Farzad, what Elon is actually building is the Resource Based Economy from Jacque Fresco and Buckminster Fuller. Check it out it will blow your mind when you see what Elon is doing.",
            "Thank you for this amazing presentation. I agree with your vision of the future.",
            "Twitter maybe better than WeChat.\nMaybe Its like Uber, Spotify, AirBnB, Paypal, YouTube, Media Company, Amazon, Tiktok, Honey and More combine",
            "FSD and Bot will start making a noticeable difference in 2030? It\u2019s going to be a long journey with the tech, government regulations.",
            "After 1 month of not watching, I barely recognize you with your new look.",
            "There hasn't been a time when we get the news without some sort of spin on it.  The truth will be a first.   Corruption disruption.  Jeannine",
            "Great big idea!\nI hope it will come true, I wanted WeChat without Chinese influence. \nDon\u2019t know if American influence is much better but it is more aligned with my belief.",
            "Thanks for the very thought provoking video.  It is not straightforward to imagine the future interrelationship of all of these rapidly developing technologies because there is the question of which ones will be predominant.  It really seems like there is unstoppable momentum behind Tesla\u2019s longterm goals.  Now that I have heard some of Elon\u2019s main objectives for Twitter, it seems so obvious and frankly easier to implement than what has already been done at Tesla and SpaceX that I am surprised another company hasn\u2019t already tackled it.",

Before agreeing to buy the company outright on April 14, he owned 73 million shares at an average price of $36.16.\n\nTwitter shares hit $51.70 on April 25 - which would have represented a $1.1 billion profit for Musk. But they've since fallen 31% to below $36 - turning that billion-dollar gain into a $40 million loss.\n\nTwitter fell 6% Tuesday as investors sold off social media and advertising stocks after Snap announced it would miss its second-quarter revenue target. It's fallen 28% in the last month and 18% so far this year.\"\n\n***\n\nThe largest online progressive news show in the world. Hosted by Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian.

            "Elon Musk is a genius in technology. He is born for that. Social media? Not so much. Matter of facts, he seems very premature in this area, and he will continue to mess up. Buying Twitter is just the beginning if he doesn't learn quickly that this is not his thing.",
            "He made a bad decision inserting himself into  politics ...  If he buys Twitter I will definitely be removing my account .He wants to empower the right wing mob to further divide and endanger America.\n\nHe really disappointed me.. How do you go  from voting for Obama twice to full blown Trumpism.. .   \n\nSad state of affairs....",
            "This video sort of points out several reasons people look at us progressives as aliens. There is just so much wrong with this segment. I wish TYTs distain for billionaires didn't get in the way of the story.",
            "Maybe the stock falls are result of him picking side in politic.",
            "Can anyone tell me when Elon dumped \u201chuge\u201d amounts of doge? Or is this another Turks lie? They were my fav, but it looks like the $$ overtook the principles. Elon is the rare exception to an influential mass on the peoples side. Shame on these fools",

            "Truth is both company's stock is overvalued.  Twitter doesn't make any money.  Like all social media companies, the only revenue it makes is by selling ads, which in the case of Twitter isn't that much.  Tesla, which is finally making money after more than a decade of losses, still isn't that profitable.  Tesla investors are betting on the future of electric car sales which isn't a bad bet given $5/gallon gas (and rising) along with legislation in the EU pushing electric cars.  However, based on current sales, Tesla's stock is grossly overvalued.",
            "I generally like TYT, but this video is not going to age well at all.",
            "\"The Invisible Hand of the Market\"\nAKA\n'Bitch Slap'",

            "Nobody has said he was going to ban democrats or allow racist speech.",
            "Such a cheap story. You complained about the temporary profit on paper that he made by buying twitter and now that all that profit and many more billions were wiped out from his net worth, this is the new hit piece?",
            "Good. It's the idea of bringing trump on.eveybodys that sick of him bit a few wloud poeple who make the noise. People will leave.  He wa spud about his plans to return it to those days... yeah. I ll be pit. Plus I read his new rules...am outta there that day.",
            "A fool and his money. Like why buy Twitter? Twitter is a toxic place and Elon Musk would not have made it better. That money could go into improving the homeless people, schools, feeding the hungry, etc. Instead he buys a crappy Social Media site.",
            "You guys are laughing now, but when he comes out on top... Don't start bagging on him. This guy will absolutely shake the haters off and keep it movie. Let's go Elon! He has my full support as a leftist. But it seems the lines moved when he bought it. So I have no idea where I am at on the political spectrum now.  I am sure some bored shitlib will be happy to let me know. I just know I am not a conservative or a shitlib.",
            "He portrays himself as a genius all I see is an idiot with way to much money burning a hole in his pocket.  Many of his badly thought out failed ventures fail badly and should of stayed as a crazy thought in is mixed up head.  As for his fire hazard cars,(yes all cars can catch fire but electric cars are very fast in becoming an inferno and very difficult to extinguish).  The fire situation should of been sorted pre releasing any car ICE and electric.  I buy a new car every 3-4 years and that new car smell is glue based.  I sat recently in a new tesla owned by a friend and the glue smell forced me out of the car fast and I started to feel the effects of the glue.",
            "Crypto currencies are just a Ponzi scheme,  a variation on the Pyramid scam.",
            "If you're on the spectrum & you add a little evil scientist you can be very intimidating. He's kinda like trump, infantile, he just says shit & people believe it. Rain Man 0.5  The guy that has to be the smartest person in the room when it's obvious you're not. But his one of a kind view of the universe & his inability to read that universe like most of us is a little creepy, scary. He's the worlds richest person, supposedly intellectually superior & he paid $300,000 for a no-happy ending, 7 mi. above the earth. Please, we can never allow him to develop any type of weapon.",
            "Buying Twitter never looked like a plausible move to most of the business analysts I could find discussing it. But when he paused the deal, all I heard was \"I'm suspending my campaign for...\" The one announcement you never hear is \"I'm resuming my campaign for...\"",
            "common sense skeptic on this platform uses musk's own words, tweets, websites, white paper, etc. to show you how everything about him is a scam. give it a look, if you see anything false you can comment and he gets back to you...elon does nothing, he literally does nothing.",
            "CANNOT WAITFOR ANOTHER MELTDOWN IN 2024.. you guys are funny until then i will return to watch you boring channel... LATER",
            "whether your like it or not.. this guy is just making his own stuff.. YOU CRAZY GIRL SHOULD WORRY ABOUT THE POLITICIANS. PRINTING 40BILLIONS TO A CORRUPT COUNTRY.,,  IS TAX PAYER MONEY..  Elons money is not our concern.. you DUMB LIBTARD...",
            "Line goes up, line goes down.  You can't explain that.",
            "Stop spreading lies pls. Elon musk never sold Dogecoin!! You owe it to your viewers to do proper research before putting any information out there.",
            "man oh man are these 2 the dumbest duo on YouTube. elon will end up acquiring Twitter and for much less than originally layed out in the beginning. elon once was a reliable vote for the democrats year in and year out. he then woke up to how far the democrats and liberals had fallen and when he spoke up he was attacked and became a victim of the rabid left also. but elon is the richest man in the world and this is not about money at this point. hes willing to lose a little cash to make a power move. if he gets Twitter he just took control of the most powerful political tool on earth. and the democrats and liberals will not be able to silence stories, or silence opponent, and do all the crap they have gotten away with for so long and it's sent them into a panic for weeks now. and oh has it been enjoyable to watch the left squirm. its wishful thinking TYT but look for elon to see this through. and look for elon to end up making billions of dollars off it when it's all said and done.",
            "The whole Twitter Frezy aside, this just proved that you can't introduce a Wealth Tax, if Elon was taxed when Tesla stock was at $1200 then would he have got compensation when the stock dropped to $700?",
            "Don't worry all of Musk's simp followers on Twitter will keep puckering up to kiss his behind.",

            "overpopulation is the one that sometimes slips from the radar. Overpopulation places a great demand on resources and land, which may be the reason for widespread environmental issues in addition to impacting global economies and standards of living.\nPoverty is to be believed as the major cause of overpopulation. High mortality rate and lack of educational resources, leads to high birth rates, resulting in a large population.\nIf overpopulation grows, this effect is said to be so widespread that the United Nations has predicted that the 48 poorest countries of the world contribute to the largest population growth. They estimate that the combined population of these countries is expected to be 1.7 billion in 2050 from 850 million in 2010.\n\nThe effects of the overpopulation are quite severe. One of these is the lack of natural resources. Earth has the capacity to only produce a limited amount of food and water, falling short of current needs of the people which are increasing day by day.\n\nRapid population growth makes the choice between high consumption and investment needed to bring more consumption in the future more scarce. Economic development depends on investment. Therefore, rapid population growth repels the investment needed for higher future consumption.\n\nWith a rapidly growing population, the adjustment becomes difficult to manage with economic and social change. Urbanization in UDC creates problems like housing, electricity, water, transport etc. In addition, the growing population is at risk of permanent environmental damage through urbanization in some rural areas.\n\nThe rapidly growing population transforms the economy into mass unemployment and low employment. As the population increases, the ratio of workers to the total population increases. The result is that with an increase in the labour force, unemployment and low employment increases. Rapid increment of the population reduces savings and investment.\n\nDomestic consumption of exportable goods also increases with rapid population growth. As a result, there is a decline in the exportable surplus. On the other hand just to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, more food and other consumer goods are needed so that demand can be fulfilled.",

But Yale and this guy is worse.\n\nSay problematic instead of a problem is a red flag as is his referring to speech he doesn't like as hate speech. \n\nFact is Twitter before Musk was full of hate speech. Just not hate speech  this guy finds objectionable like whitey, yt or yts (can also be you tubers; depends on context) or mayo Monkey, or hate toward Trump cult (who I can't stand), hate for Nick Sandmann and Kyle Rittenhouse both innocent. The list is long. \n\nBut then he proves he is just running his mouth with no actual knowledge.\n\nQuite sad for him and Yale really.\n\nHe says Musk did a poll to hide his board forced him out but there is only one board member for Twitter and that is Musk.\n\n(At Tesla Musk has more control than his voting control indicates because of supermajority voting provisions for major acts so very difficult to force Musk out)\n\nHe also refers to Musk wanting to turn Twitter into a payment vehicle (actually, Musk wants to turn it into an everything app) and says Musk still controls the PayPal engine.\n\nNo idea what this guy is talking about as PayPal was sold to EBay 20 years ago. (If this guy tries to claim patents, any patents from then are expired and I don't know that Musk controls any). \n\nThe rest of interview is totally unoriginal take on Twitter and Musk developments being parroted by the left.\n\nThis guy just runs his mouth with nothing of value to say.\n\nAnd I am not even a big fan of Musk. Just a big fan of the Constitution and Truth.",

            "nicholas doenst get it\nand its weird\nsome mental block perhaps\nhe says tesla is revolutionary, but twitter aka future X everything app isnt\nbut why is tesla? its just, as he said about twitter, evolutionary, it just took something that existed before, cars, and people could drive them, and instead made them better ,safer, and allowed them to drive themselves. all was evolutionary, cus they were somewhat safe, now safer, they could be driven, but now also by self, etc. why doesnt twitter fit this. you enable and preserve freedom of speech, you enable and make cheaper and easier transfer of money, you empower creators of any kind, therefore you also empower content of any kind, you fight bots and disinformation and enable and empower truth to exist and spread. im sure more to be added. how are these just boring and more of the same, but tesla is not? im not sure where he is confused, but he is very much so\n\nbtw according to pareto, the way i get it, is its gonna tak 20% of the effort to get 80% trusted, and 80% effort for the last 20%\nanother way to think of pareto is that the universe has diminishing returns on all things and its also a great thing to have as a game design perspective, so you dont need to patch the universe all the time with new balanced content, it came balanced to begin with by pareto\n\nlater: \"we are not a democracy but a republic\" and\n\"should there be some level of censorship? sure\"\nwhy? why should there EVER be any censorship. if you dont like what they are saying, dont listen to it, or dont act on it. what right does anyone EVER have on taking the freedom of speech away from someone?\ni think nicholas has some intellectual and moral work to do, but he seems awfully confident, meaning chance of changing alot for him, at this point of society and biology, is very near 0.\n\nis he greek? thats weird\nim greek too",

But if they do not sell, shareholders will be very angry and will sue the board. And the price per share will plummet almost overnight..thus causing shareholders to lose a VERY LARGE amount of money.

            "I have always liked Elon Musk, I especially like SpaceX, but I think he has made a big mistake with this one. Most Americans are not going to sit there and listen to trolls with their conspiracy theories and lies. It will become either a right-wing or left-wing format and there will be no one to argue with but yourself, so everyone there will agree with you, everyone else will go away.

We the people woke up and the radical left networks and platforms will not survive any longer without free speech and truth telling. The reduces left hijacked our country at very level, inducing the cia and fbi. They lost the narrative and now they lost control. This is only the begging.

            "I'm a bit skeptical, but I know a lot about BTC. So let's clear a few things up: BTC is an investment asset, like gold, it's scarce, increasingly easy to acquire, and big players like PayPal and Grayscale have it, as do many banking institutions, hedge funds, and the masses. of people. . Whales who own the self-hosted btc wallet find it difficult to sell it without doing KYC and in some cases this can lead to financial bankruptcy. People lose access to their BTC wallets, causing BTC to be frozen forever. Hype and FOMO are on the rise and most people only buy and store with btc. I mean, you have to understand that normal stock market fundamentals don't apply here. It's not a 2017 or 2018 scenario. The regulation added to BTC might even make it more desirable (although it does have a downside). Basically, anything that could prevent BTC from being immolated would be extreme regulatory restrictions and also better investment opportunities discovered by BTC owners. However, the best advice is to find a daily work/signals strategy that works well on others to accumulate and grow a very solid portfolio ahead. I have been trading with Mr. Daniel Easton's, his guidance makes trading less stressful and more profitable despite recent fluctuations. I was able to easily grow my portfolio in just 4 weeks of trading with daily signals from Daniel Easton's growing from 3.5 BTC to 12.6 BTC. Their daily signals are very accurate and generate a great positive return on investment and are available to help anyone who likes to trade cryptocurrencies.

Elon isn't going to have a leg to stand on because he doesn't actually know what he is talking about, and, therefore, will not be able to prove anything.

        "description": "Elon Musk took control of Twitter and it feels like every day there are new updates he's rolling out on the social media platform. The world\u2019s richest man has been reviewing the company\u2019s code with help from Tesla Inc. engineers, while consulting with powerful friends he trusts to help him make important decisions about where to take the product. \n\nElon Musk has wasted no time in transforming Twitter Inc. since buying the company for $44 billion on Oct. 27. He\u2019s fired most of the senior executive team, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; fired about half the staff over email; has told people at the company he\u2019ll repeal its work-from-anywhere policy, forcing employees back to the office after years of remote work; and proposed changes to try to pull in significantly more revenue from the company\u2019s fledgling subscription service. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason for the urgency: Twitter has big new bills to pay. The deal was a leveraged buyout, with Musk using borrowed money that goes on Twitter\u2019s balance sheet. Twitter\u2019s debt load has jumped to about $13 billion, up from a pre-deal situation where it owed $1.7 billion on junk bonds, along with other types of debt that could be converted into stock. The effect of this shift is that Twitter will have annual interest payments approaching $1.2 billion, up from below $100 million in the pre-Musk era. The situation could get even more expensive for Twitter, because the interest rates on about half of that debt aren\u2019t locked in and will rise with the market. The company hasn\u2019t been profitable for a full calendar year since 2019, and things weren\u2019t looking better this year. Twitter posted a net loss of $270 million in the second quarter and was projected to lose more than $200 million in the third quarter.

            "LITTLE-KNOWN FACTS ABOUT PUTIN.\r\nIn 2013, before a coup d'etat took place in Ukraine, he asked the then President of Ukraine, Yanukovych, not to use force.\r\nIn 2014, when the Ukrainian army was encircled in the Donbas, Putin called on the separatists to release the AFU soldiers from the \"boiler\" and exchange prisoners.\r\nIn 2014, realizing that the conflict could escalate into a fratricidal war, Putin proposed a plan to resolve the crisis in Ukraine \"Minsk 1\". The peace initiatives assumed the cessation of offensives by all armed formations in the Donbas, the withdrawal of all troops to a safe distance from populated areas, international control over the observance of the ceasefire, the refusal of Ukraine to use military aviation against civilians, the exchange of prisoners under the \"all for all\" scheme, as well as the opening of humanitarian corridors.\r\nIn 2015, Putin actively supported German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who proposed a special procedure for the entry into force of the law on the special status of Donbass provided for by the Minsk agreements. \r\nIn 2015, in order to resolve the crisis in Ukraine as soon as possible, he proposed to sign an additional agreement \"Minsk 2\", where the obligations of the parties to the conflict were spelled out in more detail.\r\nIn 2017, Putin proposed to place a UN mission on the line of contact in the Donbas to ensure the safety of employees of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. Later, Putin did not rule out that such a mission could be located throughout the conflict, but with the consent of the proclaimed republics of Donbass. \r\nIn 2021, Putin warns NATO countries against crossing \"red lines\" and invited them to dialogue, but his proposal was rejected.\r\nIn 2022, after the outbreak of the war, Putin forbade the military to shoot at civilian objects and, if possible, at industrial infrastructure, which greatly hindered the army's advance.\r\nBut after numerous terrorist acts of the Ukrainian regime, he allowed the bombing of the energy infrastructure. By the way, the Russian army is the only one in the last 100 years that complies with the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.\r\nFor 22 years of his manifestation, Putin has not made a single geopolitical mistake, and the Russian economy, as noted by leading world analysts, has achieved outstanding results, even despite unprecedented sanctions.\r\nPutin did not start this war against his people in 2014 \u2013 but he will end it!\r\nWill you still believe fake news?\r\nIn the West, everyone expects Vietnam, Iraq, Libya from Putin... In the West, everyone expects Vietnam, Iraq, Libya from Putin... That's not going to happen. Russia is not the USA!\r\n\r\nP.S. The sign \"Z\" is the Old Slavic letter \"Z\", which was thrown out of the Russian, Slavic alphabet by the efforts of darkness for a long time. This letter is the main protective sign of all Slavs. This letter carries protection against the penetration of dark energy. This is the \"Earth\" itself, as a Universal structure, as a form of life of all things created by God. The very spelling of this letter says this: the upper line crosses out the Sky, the lower line crosses out the Earth, and the diagonal line crosses out the space between Heaven and Earth, closing the entrance of dark energy.",

If Elon unbans all BUT these leftest idiots, then he opens himself up for claims of hypocrisy.  If he just unbans everyone, then they can't feasibly (though they'll try lol) claim he's playing favorites for the right.  He can say \"hey, I let everyone out of jail, now lets see what they do with it\" ... believe me when I say it and I'm sure you know this too ... those on the left will quickly get themselves banned again because they're so full of themselves and then he can sit there on the moral right and say, \"well, see, they re-earned their ban doing the same thing.  sorry left, you are s.o.l.\"  I may or may not have outlined this well, but I hope it made sense :) Happy Turkey Day everyone!",

It lacks both credibility and any merit.  \nThis is how pump and dump schemes start...  the only difference is, there is no market to play with it being a now privately owned entity. \nSo that leads me to one conclusion...  This is just another BS media channel trying to push its BS right-winged stupidity on Elon fan-boys who do not seem to think for themselves.  \n Just like this new hype for tRumps run for President.

This is not a challenge that arises now, presumably the challenge was there before he took over, thus, there is nothing inherently new just because Musk is taking over. \n\nSometimes it seems like people are more afraid of loss of the ability to influence what views are allowed and which ones are taboo.",

Elon Musk and Peter Thiel will both go down with their misdirected zeal.",
            "Elon Musk is incompetent. He gets kicked off every board he's on. He's a raging PR machine promoting Himself. If journalists took a long hard look at his history instead of just accepting everything Musk says they'd see he's a big narcist with way too much money at his disposal.

I understand The need to edit out crazy talk and threats in order to keep the platform \u201cfamily friendly \u201c as Twitter claimed during the election.     But Twitter went way beyond what would be considered maintaining a proper decorum to taking sides in a debate to sway opinion and then banning altogether tweets from Trump or any of his supporters.   Supposedly this was done to keep advertisers happy!   But no one was buying it.   Musk will fire the board members and replace them with more middle of the road people.    Maybe Twitter won\u2019t be run by a bunch of WOKE P\\/$$\u00a5$ anymore?   The original founder only owns a 2% share of outstanding shares!!??     Talk about WOKE!!

            "Mr Pitt accuses Elon of \"childish, it's immature, and it's narcissistic ...but he needs to stop acting like a child and start acting like an adult\". No, Pitt is confused. He is upset that Elon cannot be CONTROLLED and doesn't kowtow to the elites and \"behave\" they way the elites want. The elites cannot abide someone who they cannot control and reuses to _obey_ and is beating them at their own games. It's actually quite telling that the elites would call him a \"child\" and claim he needs to \"grow up\". What they really mean is that they want Elon to STFU, _obey_ , stop being adversarial and upsetting their apple cart, and just bend the knee to their overlord authoritarianism.\n\nIt all comes down to Elon being a threat they all cannot control. The left hates and fears Elon because he would promote _free speech_ and undermine their censorious CONTROL over speech. The elites hate and fear him because they cannot CONTROL him and make him comply and \"play the game\" the way they want the game played.",

Do you think it was appropriate for a regulatory body (ie the SEC) to request anyone agree to something which breaches the first amendment?  I don't!  The law applies to everyone - and more so to regulators.",

So there would be immense pressure to settle. \n\nI don't necessarily disagree with Harvey on the merits addressed. But he was Not asked, nor did he offer any note or explanation on why Short Sellers and Financial publications were not investigated.

            "Twitter employees are the pile of stinking dead bodies, sacraficed at the temple of progressivism.\n\nThey are Irredeemable, unsavable,  lacking the humanity required feel compassion and barely have the reasoning ability of small insects. \n\n They are human in form, but  without conscience or the ability to know right and wrong.  They are more animal than human.\n\nTwitter employees should be pitted but never excused.",
            "Twitter is worth way less than 1 B take it or leave it. They are worth nothing with their scam and liars. Elon should not pay more than 1B. The CEO is an Indian !!! any questions?? Without Trump, no one knows Twitter.",
            "Let's think about this logically - if any social media had the capability to determine with 100% accuracy which accounts are bots - they would be using that technology.\nThis isn't hard. They already do attempt to filter out as many bots as they can, and estimate there are more at any given time that they do not catch.\nThe reason Elon Musk also won't be able to determine the # of bots is because it's an unsolvable problem with the variables given. You must by necessity make assumptions.",
            "Now Elon Musk is scrolling over the data feeling like a moron realizing the complexity with determining a precise % for bots with vast amounts of data necessarily having to make broad assumptions lol.\nGood luck.",
            "Free speech is not the same of right of defamation. The good thing about Twitter being purged of fake accounts, is that suing for defamation become possible, because in a free society anybody can say anything, but being accountable of every word.",
            "If the twitter executives provide false information about how many bots, that is fraud and those executives can face jail time for fraud..  it is like an offer on a home, the seller has to provide any information to the buyer that could affect the property.. Failure to be fully transparent, could lead to massive lawsuits against the seller and criminal charges..    Either way, if Elon made an offer based on the number of bots they had reported to the SEC at the time, and the number is different (fraudulent claims by Twitter) he will own Twitter with a massive rebate he gets from the court after he sues them.. And if he gets the information and realizes that it is far more than the had reported to the SEC, they are screwed because that would give Elon the right to withdraw the offer on basis of fraudulent claims about the property.  and one that happens, all the other investors will join a class action lawsuit to close down Twitter..   oh.. sad day...LOL",

Plus, if the rumors are right, her surrogacy pregnancy was done with one of the embryos they had created while together (elon and amber, that is). This is truly what it's all about here.",

We had a choice to join them and their goals or leave. We were not offered any type of severance package if we decided to leave. So i have no sympathy for any twitter employee. After all; they like other liberals celebrated when Biden put hard working Americans out of work over his radical left wing crazy green policy and covid vaccine mandates that demanded a vaccine be taken that did nothing to stop or even slow the spread of virus.

            "Tesla stocks will be under $100 by New Years and will fall to below $70 by the end of the first quarter of 2023, but things won't stop there, by the end of 2023, Tesla will be worth about $30-40, making them on par with other auto manufacturers of their quality. All anyone has to do is actually follow the auto industry to know whats going on, Tesla has competition from companies that have been around for decades, game over.",

            "He said he would not sell last time he sold, and then he sold anyway.  This means nothing.  Its just noise.",
            "When did Yahoo Finance become a mouthpiece for the Democrats? Notice how the facts revealed in the Twitter files - which show the institutional challenges he faces. Notice how the US administration has suddenly put him under a microscope. Are you trying to replace Trump as a whipping boy? Sure seems like you need one to maintain your own revenues and viewership.",

I've told customers not to buy things it's not weird you can sell someone something for 100 dollars one day or you can be honest and sell them 10 grand over a year instead for example.  Ethics in business is a precious commodity.",
