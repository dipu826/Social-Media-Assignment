            "Victory\nIn the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.[48:29]\nMuhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers wiith (the sight of) them. Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward.\n\n\n[33:45]\nO Prophet! Lo! We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner.\n\n[33:46]\nAnd as a summoner unto Allah by His permission, and as a lamp that giveth light.\n\n[33:47]\nAnd announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great bounty from Allah.\n\n[33:48]\nAnd incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their noxious talk, and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.\n\n[4:69]\nWhoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they!\n\n[4:70]\nThat is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower.\n\n\n[7:155]\nAnd Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when the trembling came on them, he said: My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did ? It is but Thy trial (of us). Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness.\n\n\n[7:156]\nAnd ordain for us in this world that which is good, and in the Hereafter (that which is good), Lo! We have turned unto Thee. He said: I smite with My punishment whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things, therefore I shall ordain it for those who ward off (evil) and pay the poor- due, and those who believe Our revelations;\n\n\n[7:157]\nThose who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with them. He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong. He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul; and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear. Then those who believe in him, and honour him, and help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him: they are the successful.\n\n\n[7:158]\nSay (O Muhammad): O mankind! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah to you all - (the messenger of) Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and He giveth death. So believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believeth in Allah and in His Words, and follow him that haply ye may be led aright.\n\n\n[33:56]\nLo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.\n\n\n[66:8]\nO ye who believe! Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands; they will say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! Lo! Thou art Able to do all things.\n\n\n[21:107]\nWe sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\u061b",

        "description": "The \"Squawk Box\" team discusses Elon Musk's offloading of Tesla shares heading into the end of 2021. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi\u00a0\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has sold another 934,090 shares, or about $1.02 billion worth of his holdings, in his electric car and solar business according to financial filings published late Tuesday.\n\nMusk also exercised options to buy nearly 1.6 million Tesla shares at a strike price of $6.24 per share, granted to him via a 2012 compensation package.\n\nIn exercising his options this quarter, Musk\u2019s holdings in Tesla have increased from about 170.5 million shares to over 177 million shares, the Wall Street Journal first reported.\n\nSince Nov. 8, Musk has been on a selling spree, partly to pay his looming tax bills on those options.\n\nThe celeb-CEO polled his tens of millions of Twitter followers in the first week of November asking if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. They voted yes. But a major portion of the sales that followed the entertaining Twitter poll were part of a plan that Musk adopted in September this year.\n\nUnder 10b5-1 rules, corporate insiders (including CEOs) can trade their own equity as part of pre-announced portfolio management plan. They must declare in advance when and how they plan to trade to protect themselves from later accusations of insider trading.\n\nThis year, Tesla shares have risen more than 54% making Musk the world\u2019s wealthiest person. His net worth is now over $275 billion, according to estimates by Forbes.\n\nThat wealth is derived from Musk\u2019s ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. He currently doesn\u2019t take a salary or cash bonuses, and had not sold a large number of shares in Tesla until this year. He had, instead, taken out sizable loans against a portion of his Tesla shares.\n\nSince taxpayers only pay taxes on income or stock once it is sold, Musk never paid a large amount in taxes annually relative to his net worth, ProPublica previously reported.\n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tweeted that Musk was \u201cfreeloading off everyone else,\u201d since he didn\u2019t pay federal income taxes in 2018.\n\nNow, Musk is expected to pay what is likely to be the largest single individual tax bill in U.S. history, with federal and California income taxes estimated to top $11 billion. He will be required to pay this tax bill in order to receive compensation of more than $23 billion, in the form of stock options that would otherwise expire in August.\n\nThe centi-billionaire discussed his riches and tax strategy during a bevy of December press appearances, including interviews with the Financial Times and Time Magazine after both outlets both named him person of the year for 2021.\n\nCapping off his year-end publicity efforts, Elon Musk sat with the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee on Tuesday last week. During that interview he said, \u201cI sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here.\u201d\n\nThe next day on Twitter, Musk clarified, \u201cThis assumes completion of the 10b sale.\u201d And noted, \u201cWhen the 10b preprogrammed sales complete. There are still a few tranches left, but almost done\u201d in a subsequent tweet.\n\nBy some estimates, Musk still has more than a million more shares to sell to reach his 10% November target of around 17 million shares. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment or more information about the sum total he plans to sell to hit that goal.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk sold nearly $5 billion in Tesla stock, according to financial filings out Wednesday evening. He still holds more than 166 million shares.\n\nHis trust sold more than 3.5 million shares worth over $3.88 billion in a flurry of trades carried out Tuesday and Wednesday. Those transactions were not marked as 10b5, meaning they were not scheduled sales.\n\nEarlier Wednesday evening, filings showed Musk is selling a separate block of Tesla shares via a plan that he set in motion on Sept. 14 this year. Those sales amount to more than 930,000 shares worth over $1.1 billion.\n\nMusk sold these shares in part to satisfy tax obligations related to an exercise of stock options.\n\nBefore that sale plan was made public, Musk asked his 62.5 million Twitter followers to vote in an informal poll, telling them their vote would determine the future of his Tesla holdings. The filings reveal that, in fact, he knew some of his shares were slated for sale this week.\n\nFollowing the Twitter poll, shares of Tesla slumped more 15% over Monday and Tuesday, before rebounding more than 4% on Wednesday.\n\nThe stock was higher in after-hours trade on Thursday.\n\nCitadel CEO Ken Griffin, speaking at the DealBook Online Summit on Wednesday, said he personally did not want to see Musk sell. \u201cIndividuals like Elon Musk, like Jeff Bezos have transformed life, and we want to keep them in control of their companies, as long as they\u2019ve got the energy and the ambition to keep moving the business forward.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Musk signaled that he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his options in the fourth quarter. At an appearance at the Code Conference in September, Musk said when his stock options expire at Tesla, his marginal tax rate would be over 50%.\n\nCurrent and former board members including chairwoman Robyn Denholm, Elon Musk\u2019s brother Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias have offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla shares since Oct. 28 after Tesla\u2019s market cap surpassed $1 trillion.\n\nAmong those insider sales, Kimbal Musk\u2019s was the only transaction that was not listed as a 10b5, or planned sale. Kimbal Musk sold around $109 million worth of his shares a day ahead of his brother\u2019s Twitter poll.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Other than that, he should really stop whining about a one-time billionaires tax, which would be used to fund _the very same infrastructure_ his products depend on! And not only that, but he could only have made a profit if he took advantage of the infrastructure that was paid with taxpayer's money (distribution services using public highways, employees commuting to work, etc.). Yes, it's about time he pays back into the system, and all others like him who were able to reap the benefits of a rigged game for far too long. Would he rather see poor ol' Joe across the street who's barely able to afford rent pay more in taxes than he does? I sure hope not; but there is no doubt in my mind that _some_ billionaires in this country would secretly answer in the affirmative. I'm all for space exploration --- but let's make sure that the basic needs of the American people (healthcare, housing, education, etc.) are met first. Are we all okay with that? Good.\n\nAnd by the way, I voted yes on that Twitter poll. Now let's hope the next one is about whether he should pay the same tax rate as everyone else, let alone more."

            "India is full of itself. Run Elon run!",
            "As usual people are missing the point with Elon and Tesla. His companies are very successful, strong and resourceful... this is a natural effect from 1st principles thinking and not a neccesitive goal of Elon and his mission. He must enter India for there is where many cars are spewing pollutants into the environment....and so this environment must transition asap. It just so happens that the best way to transition a market quickly is to also do so intelligently. The irony is Tesla can appear as a ruthless competitor taking over the market when in fact they are merely sticking to a simple original path. Tesla will work and will succeed and will become the largest  company to ever exist while simultaneously transforming the earths biosphere/ecosystem into a much healthier, vibrant, ALIVE one. When you include the other components to Elons mission such as x app in particular... meant to be the everything app built by the person who is likely one of the best \"off the cuff\"/out of box thinking programmers on the planet combined with a HUGE TEAM, an army if you will,  of people who are the best at what they do AND are given an excellent wage and benefits... why? Because its nice, because it is the right thing to do, sure both these things... but is is smart money wise... short term, creating a \"lean mean fighting machine\" as is the general business model... absolutely not... but is it the wisest... the most intelligent... long term \"tactic\" for the overall mission? Yes. Why ... because the missions success is all that matters, first principles thinking is literally the first principle and the purpose of the mission/business itself... accruing wealth, power, market share etc are.merwly symptoms of.a.mission succeeding..... why? Because Elon created a company to make hime.the richest in the world ever? No, to make him the most powerful man on earth able to move mts at a whim? No... and to be honest Elon is none of these things, although it may appear so and many media presentations will focus on this b3ing the case the are.missing.the forrest for the trees. I will explain this all simply and we should all hope, pray and.even assist in any waynpossible towards this \"mission\" because it is not Elon who is the richest, most powerful being on.the earth, getring stronger and more powerful lite4ally by the nanosecond",

        "description": "Tesla has had a strong start to 2020 and, if it continues, CEO Elon Musk could be in for a big payday. Tim Higgins, reporter at the Wall Street Journal, and Bob Lutz, former vice chairman of General Motors, joins \"Squawk Box\" to discuss.\n\nTesla delivered a record 112,000 vehicles globally during the fourth quarter, significantly topping Wall Street estimates and achieving CEO Elon Musk\u2019s year-end sales goal.\n\nWall Street expected Tesla to deliver 106,000 vehicles to customers during the fourth quarter, which would have just met the company\u2019s annual delivery goal of between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles, a 45% to 65% increase from 2018.\n\nTesla said it delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles last year, an impressive 50% jump from 2018.\n\nShares of the electric-car maker surged more than 4% in morning trading to $448, a 49% rise rise over the last 12 months.\n\nTesla\u2019s deliveries are a closely watched number in the industry, providing the closest proximation to sales. The company said it counts a car as delivered \u201cif it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct.\u201d The deliveries number is a barometer for how the company is performing ahead of releasing its quarterly earnings.\n\nTesla said it delivered 92,550 Model 3 cars and 19,450 Model S and X vehicles during the fourth quarter. The company was expected to deliver 87,900 Model 3, 9,800 Model S and 9,300 Model X vehicles, according to an average of analysts surveyed by FactSet.\n\nInvestors were also watching production numbers. In the second and third quarters of 2019, Tesla delivered more cars than it produced. The production versus deliveries gap widened in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Tesla manufactured 96,155 vehicles and delivered 97,000 vehicles. In the fourth quarter, it manufactured 104,891 vehicles and delivered 112,000.\n\nThe electric-car maker said it has produced just under 1,000 cars that are ready for sale at its new factory in Shanghai. Tesla started delivering vehicles to Chinese customers late last month.\n\nTesla said it will \u201ccontinue to focus on expanding production\u201d in both the U.S. and China, where the company reports it has demonstrated production run-rate capability of greater than 3,000 units per week. That production rate, according to Tesla, excludes local battery pack production that began in late December.\n\nDaniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, called Tesla\u2019s deliveries to end the year \u201cimpressive\u201d and \u201canother step in the right direction\u201d for its Fremont assembly plant in California. Soundly beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates in the quarter \u201cwas another major feather in the cap for Musk & Co.,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile part of this recent rally has been a massive short covering, it has also been driven by underlying fundamental improvement as the company\u2019s ability to impressively not just talk the talk but walk the walk has been noticed by the Street and the optimism around the story has grown markedly from the dark days seen earlier in 2019,\u201d Ives said in a note to investors Friday morning.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk made personal appearances at the company\u2019s Fremont car plant and delivery center to cheer on employees and Tesla fans who volunteered to deliver cars to customers ahead of the year-end deadline.\n\nCustomers who received their cars in 2019 qualified for an $1,875 tax credit. But if the car was ordered in 2019, and delivered in 2020, they would not qualify.\n\nTesla is now shipping its vehicles to more locations around the world than ever before, including in the U.K. and China.\n\nThis broader customer base is one reason why Tesla assured investors in the third quarter that it would hit the low end of its prior guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries for the full year. The company also wrote then: \u201cDeliveries should increase sequentially and annually, with some expected fluctuations from seasonality. We are highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\u201d\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube\n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

        "description": "CNBC's 'Squawk Box' discuss a recent Twitter poll from Tesla CEO Elon Musk asking users whether he should sell 10% of his shares in the company. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla shares fell by more than 4% in early morning trading Monday after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock in the electric vehicle company.\n\nShares of Tesla slipped 4.2% to $1,170 at 8:19 a.m. ET Monday, down from $1,222.09 at market close on Friday. Earlier in pre-market trade on Monday, shares fell over 7%.\n\nIt comes after Musk asked his 62.5 million Twitter followers to determine the future of a chunk of his Tesla holdings.\n\nIn a Twitter poll launched Saturday, Musk said: \u201cMuch is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. Do you support this?\u201d\n\nThe billionaire gave people the option to vote \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d and pledged to abide by the results of the poll, whichever way it went.\n\nSome 3,519,252 people responded, and 57.9% of them voted for \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMusk previously said he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his shares in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn September, Musk said at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California, that his marginal tax rate will be over 50% when his stock options expire at Tesla, and that he was already planning to sell soon.\n\n\u201cI have a bunch of options that are expiring early next year, so ... a huge block of options will sell in Q4 \u2014 because I have to or they\u2019ll expire,\u201d he said.\n\n Jefferies raised their price target for shares of Tesla from $950 to $1,400 in a note on Monday.\n\nAnalyst Philippe Houchois wrote: \u201cWithout dismissing execution risk, Tesla is getting to a position where it can balance affordability and speed, goals which are as important as profitability in Elon Musk\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTesla looks set to gain share from large OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], potentially claiming a disproportionate share of the industry profit pool in the coming 3-5 years as legacies enter the margin dilutive EV transition phase.\u201d\n\nOther current and former Tesla board members, including Robyn Denholm, Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias have also offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla stock since Oct. 28, as the company\u2019s stock soared on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nShares climbed after Tesla posted a record third quarter and car rental company Hertz announced that it was ordering 100,000 Tesla vehicles for its fleet. Musk waited for a week after Hertz made its announcement to say that Tesla had not in fact signed a contract with the company yet. Prior to that statement, he taunted investors who were short shares of Tesla on Twitter, writing: \u201cTesla Hertz shorts.\u201d\n\nSince the Hertz announcement, Tesla shares have risen by more than 30% and so has Musk\u2019s net worth.\n\nElon\u2019s tax bill\n\nNo matter the results of the Twitter poll, Musk would have likely started selling millions of shares this quarter. That\u2019s because he\u2019s facing a looming tax bill of more than $15 billion.\n\nHis options expire in August 2022 but in order to exercise them, he has to pay the income tax on the gain.\n\nSince the options are taxed as an employee benefit or compensation, they will be taxed at top ordinary-income levels, or 37% plus the 3.8% net investment tax. He will also have to pay the 13.3% top tax rate in California since the options were granted and mostly earned while he was a California tax resident.\n\nCombined, the state and federal tax rate will be 54.1%. So the total tax bill on his options, at the current price, would be $15 billion.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

He still holds more than 166 million shares in the company.\n\nMusk sold about $6.9 billion worth of stock in the company over the course of the week. Some of the shares were sold in part to satisfy tax obligations related to an exercise of stock options.\n\nThose sales impacted the company\u2019s share price. Tesla stock declined 15.4% for the week, marking the company\u2019s worst one-week performance in 20 months. It was also the worst week for Tesla stock ever, excluding declines in February and March 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic sent markets tumbling.\n\nTesla shares are still up around 46% year to date following a record closing price of $1,229.91 on Nov. 4, 2021.\n\nOn Nov. 6, Musk asked his more than 60 million Twitter followers to vote in an informal poll and told them their vote would determine the future of his Tesla holdings. Financial documents filed during the week show that some were slated for sale this week no matter the outcome of the poll, however.\n\nPreviously, Musk signaled that he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his options in the fourth quarter.

In addition, the Consumer Reports auto team made the Model 3 a \u201cTop Pick\u201d among vehicles with a sticker price between $45,000 and $55,000.\n\nThe positive review of Tesla and the Model 3 is the latest indication the automaker is making steady progress improving the quality and reliability of its vehicles. When Tesla first began building and selling the Model 3, in 2018, there were numerous stories detailing production issues at the company\u2019s assembly plant in Fremont, California.\n\nFisher said those issues likely hurt the quality of initial versions of the Model 3 when Tesla was ramping up production of the car. \u201cThey changed the seats, they changed the glass, they changed the suspension in the first few months of production of the Tesla Model 3,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cBecause everything is changing there are new problems every time you make changes in production.\u201d\n\nFisher says Consumer Reports noticed an improvement in the Model 3 starting in the middle of last year when production at Tesla\u2019s plant stabilized. \u201cOnce they settled that down, they were able to improve the reliability,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rankings and \u201ctop picks\u201d are based on a variety of factors, including an owner satisfaction survey of Consumer Reports members who review their vehicles. In addition, the Consumer Reports auto team tests dozens of new vehicles at the firm\u2019s test track in Connecticut.\n\nThis year, the company ranks Porsche as the top auto brand, followed by Genesis and Subaru. By comparison, Consumer Reports listed Fiat as the worst brand, right behind Mitsubishi and Jeep. CNBC reached out to Fiat for a comment regarding the latest rankings.\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube\n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk sold about $1.05 billion in stock on Tuesday evening, according to financial filings posted this week. The sales were scheduled in September to exercise options that were set to expire in 2022.\n\nMusk has sold a total of $9.85 billion in Tesla stock this month, including the $6.9 billion he sold the week of Nov. 10 and another $1.9 billion he sold on Nov. 15 and Nov. 16. Some of the shares were sold in part to satisfy tax obligations related to an exercise of stock options.\n\nMusk and his trust still hold more than 169 million shares in the company.\n\nTesla shares fell 15.4% the week ended Nov. 12, marking the worst week for Tesla stock in 20 months after Musk began selling shares. Shares of Tesla were up about 1% on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMusk ran an informal Twitter poll on Nov. 6 asking his more than 60 million Twitter followers whether or not he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. The poll ultimately ended with users telling Musk to sell.\n\nBut, Musk had already indicated earlier this year he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his options in the fourth quarter. During an appearance at the Code Conference in September, he said when his stock options expire at Tesla, his marginal tax rate would be over 50%.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

        "description": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk share a complicated relationship, which is marked by Musk's initial criticism of Trump's administration, labelling it a \u201cgerontocracy.\u201d However, after feeling snubbed by President Joe Biden, Musk's stance has shifted. Despite leading the EV market, Musk's Tesla was repeatedly ignored by the Biden administration, influenced by the United Auto Workers union.\n\nIn August 2021, Biden held an EV event, excluding Tesla, further straining relations. Under Biden, regulatory actions targeted Musk's companies, deepening the rift. Recently, Musk co-founded America PAC, a pro-Trump super PAC, and plans to contribute $45 million.\n\nMusk insists his super PAC aligns with views on meritocracy and personal freedom. Influenced by key tech associates, Musk has become more politically active, making him a significant wildcard in Trump's political strategy. \n\n#trump #musk #elonmusk #tesla #biden #election \n\nConnect With The Australian Online \n\ud83d\udda5 https://www.theaustralian.com.au\n\nFollow Us:\nFacebook  \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/theaustralian\nInstagram \u25ba https://bit.ly/39w5T2j\nTwitter       \u25ba https://twitter.com/australian\nLinkedIn    \u25ba   https://www.linkedin.com/company/1008560/admin/feed/posts/\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Podcast     \u25ba  https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/the-front/podcast/7e7d42e8c77b597cf8532d2e0c847e10\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Subscribe To Our YouTube Channel: http://bit.ly/1OT7tw4\n\n#breakingnews\n#news\n#headlinenews",

Elon Musk Reveals 250.000 Miles Range In 18 Months! Hi, Welcome to Tesla Car World! You may not know this, but Elon Musk often refers to Semi Trucks as Tesla's ultimate money-saving machine. But Why? We found that if a diesel truck drives an average of 150,000 miles per year, the fuel cost is around $75,000. But with the Tesla Semi, drivers only spend between $20,000 and $30,000, saving between $46,000 and $53,000 annually \u2014 that's a 60% to 70% reduction! Incredible, right? PepsiCo drivers have even admitted they don\u2019t want to go back to diesel trucks after getting used to the Semi. And now, Tesla has just launched the new Sleeper Cab version, along with a ton of newly released performance data. Dive in and explore it all right now!\n\nNEW Tesla Semi Sleeper Cab Version Launched! Elon Musk Reveals 250.000 Miles Range In 18 Months! You might be wondering, if the Semi Truck is such a good vehicle, why doesn't Tesla produce it in mass volume?\nBut you know , among all Tesla EV models, Semi Truck is perhaps Tesla's most challenging vehicle. It\u2019s no coincidence that the number of electric trucks has barely increased over the years. You know, the main reason is that Tesla has not yet established an automated electric truck production line at its Nevada factory.\n\nNEW Tesla Semi Sleeper Cab Version Launched! Elon Musk Reveals 250.000 Miles Range In 18 Months! The production of the Semi is still mostly done manually. Moreover, the scale of Semi production is also limited. As you know, the dimension of these big rigs requires a large facility, and Giga Nevada is not sufficient to meet the demand as this factory also has to prioritize battery cell production. This makes the production process slower and more complicated.\n===\n#888999evs #teslacarworld #teslacar #888999 #semitruck #teslasemi \nsubcribe: https://bit.ly/3i7gILj",

        "description": "The 'Power Lunch' team discusses Elon Musk's recent tweet calling for a breakup of Amazon.\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Thursday tweeted Thursday that he thinks it\u2019s time to break up Amazon.\n\nHis tweet came after writer Alex Berenson tweeted a screenshot showing that his upcoming book about Covid-19 doesn\u2019t meet Amazon guidelines for sale. Berenson has been a critic of the coronavirus lockdown and has suggested that the risks of serious illness or death are much lower than reported, especially for younger people.\n\n\u201cThis is insane @JeffBezos,\u201d Musk said, tagging the Amazon CEO. \u201cTime to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!\u201d\n\nAmazon said later that the book was removed in error, is being reinstated and that it has contacted Berenson.\n\nMusk has been a vocal critic of government policy during the coronavirus pandemic. He has also tweeted in favor of reopening the country and during a Tesla earnings call said stay-at-home orders are fascist, among other things.\n\nMusk has a record of making strange remarks on Twitter. His latest example was on May 1, when he tweeted that Tesla stock \u201cis too high.\u201d In 2018, he said on Twitter he was going to take Tesla private when its stock price his $420 and that he had already secured funding. The SEC sued over that tweet, and both Musk and Tesla paid separate $20 million fines as part of a settlement, and Musk agreed to submit his tweets to an overseer from then on.\n\nIn July 2019, the DOJ announced an antitrust review into Big Tech. In September, the House Judiciary Committee requested documents from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet. Bezos is the only CEO who has expressed reservations about appearing before the committee, Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said in May.\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: \nhttps://cnb.cx/2JdMwO7 \n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well.

        "description": "In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called Tesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would transform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would want\u2014 affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. \n\nIn 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.\n\nOver the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit.\n\n Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a \u201chell of a ride,\u201d and he took Wall Street along with him.

            "MSM anchors from FOX, CNBC, CNN to Leave-Kevin, were to call out Elon Musk(D by heart) for a drunken trumper, just 3 months ago. He obviously is not that stupid, to support the sinking MAGA supertanker. Fundamentals, revenue and profit matters, and will prevail over FAKE news. Worlds best space rockets and supercars, were not invented by a fool, or a crook like the former, but by a genious, that most losers didnt have the brains to understand and appriciate. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6",
            "Hahaha, CNBC hates having to post these Tesla facts & successes!  They're still lying about demand, they cut prices to not only increase demand but to allow US consumers to get the tax credit.  They can because their margins are 10X higher than their competitors.  Tesla is $175 right now, & in 2023, barring a hard recession, Tesla delivers over 2 million vehicles.   BUY, BUY, BUY",

        "description": "Former General Motors executive Bob Lutz, a longtime critic of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, said Wednesday that he\u2019s now encouraged by the direction of the electric-vehicle manufacturer.\n\n\u201cTesla is finally being run like a normal business,\u201d the former GM vice chairman said on \u201cSquawk on the Street.\u201d\n\n\u2033[Musk] finally reined in his costs,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cHe\u2019s reduced personnel and reduced unnecessary expenditures and has basically done what any other businessman would do in a situation where you\u2019re selling a bunch of stuff but you\u2019re not profitable\u201d on a sustained basis.\n\nIn October, Tesla reported a surprise third-quarter profit as part of a strong stretch of months for the carmaker. Along with the completion of its Shanghai factory and better-than-expected fourth-quarter deliveries, shares of Tesla more than doubled since late September, trading as high as $498 in Wednesday\u2019s session.\n\nLutz, who retired in 2010 after 47 years in the auto industry, had previously said he thought Tesla was \u201cheaded for the graveyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will never make money on the Model 3 because the cost is way too high,\u201d Lutz said in September 2018. \u201cHe\u2019s got 9,000 people in that assembly plant producing less than 150,000 cars a year. The whole thing just doesn\u2019t compute.\u201d\n\nBut the situation, particularly regarding the Model 3, has dramatically changed, Lutz said Wednesday. Tesla has \u201cachieved a volume break through, with the plant in China opening and selling a lot of Model 3s,\u201d he added.\n\nFirst debuted in the summer of 2017, the Model 3 had a \u201crelatively slow start,\u201d Lutz contended. But it became the bestselling electric vehicle in the world in the first 11 months of 2019.\n\nLutz said that accelerating Model 3 sales, especially ones with bells and whistles, have been aided by its perception as a high-end alternative to cars from BMW or Mercedes-Benz. He said he believed, when factoring in additional features, a lot of Model 3s were actually selling around $55,000 to $60,000.\n\n\u201cAs long as they can keep that premium pricing, which is as I say about $33,000 over where they had originally talked about, obviously that car is going to be profitable,\u201d Lutz said.\n\nTesla had previously advertised plans for a $35,000 version of the Model 3, but the approach was significantly altered in the spring. In October, Tesla raised the price of its most affordable version of the Model 3 about $500 to $39,490.\n\nEven so, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 has actually contributed to an overall decline in the average price of electric vehicles, according to data from Cox Automotive that publication Inside EVs reported on. The average cost to buy an EV in the U.S. in September was around $56,000. One year earlier it was around $64,000, according to the Inside EVs report.\n\nLutz said he also thought Musk, who is known for his sometimes eccentric personality and bold predictions, has moderated.\n\n\u201cHe has been quite adept,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cThe encouraging thing to me about Tesla is from Elon there is less talk, less bluster ... he is focusing on the business, focusing on the product and focusing on cost control.\u201d\n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://www.cnbc.com/pro/?__source=youtube\n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Before agreeing to buy the company outright on April 14, he owned 73 million shares at an average price of $36.16.\n\nTwitter shares hit $51.70 on April 25 - which would have represented a $1.1 billion profit for Musk. But they've since fallen 31% to below $36 - turning that billion-dollar gain into a $40 million loss.\n\nTwitter fell 6% Tuesday as investors sold off social media and advertising stocks after Snap announced it would miss its second-quarter revenue target.

Full details are in the video.\n\nElon Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner and CEO of Twitter, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation. With an estimated net worth of around $196 billion as of February 15, 2023, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is the second-wealthiest person in the world, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time billionaires list ... (From Wikipedia)\n\nMars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, larger only than Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos ... (Wikipedia)\n\nStarship is a fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX. Standing 120 m (390 ft) tall and with more than twice the thrust of the Saturn V, it is designed to be the tallest and most powerful launch vehicle ever built, and the first capable of total reusability. Partially and fully expendable variants may also be developed. The Starship launch vehicle is made up of the Super Heavy first-stage booster and the Starship second stage. The second stage functions as a self-contained spacecraft for carrying crew or cargo once in orbit. Both stages are powered by Raptor engines that burn liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellants in a highly efficient, full-flow staged combustion power cycle. Both rocket stages are designed to be reused by landing vertically at the launch pad or at a separate platform ...(From Wikipedia)\n\n#shorts #short #elonmusk #joerogan #starship #aircraft #astronomy #mars #planets #planet #orbit #spacecraft #spacecraft #spacex #space #nasa #time #journey #discover #entertainment #education #inspiration #inspirational #astrophysicist #astrophysics #tesla #twiter #jupiter",

Use your brain a little. Why isnt anyone saying anything about that? Because all they can do is cherry pick to make a case in a situation they have no point to make just to get views and clicks and look better using someone elses fame to do so",
            "Okay so its ignorant to do any trade on the stock market and the crypto market based on other peoples opinions without doing the proper research yourself. Its not on elon or anyone for promoting. Its still a decision each individual has to make on there own. Elon nor anyone else forced anyone to purchase outside there will. People need to acknowledge and face there own mistakes, not blame others for there own personal failure. Its like purchasing a product because its cheaper so you think your getting a discount but when you get it, its made with cheap materials and is only a counterfeit stolen design from china that breaks in a week, and then sueing for it when all you had to do is research a little and see it wasnt on the official site of the products designer and just another shop taking peoples money for someone elses work. Except in elons case, it was far less of an issue because he didnt sell anything, he just tweeted something. If you spend your life saving because of a tweet, you might just deserve to lose. You cant sue casinos for you losing a bet, and investing is just as much a gamble. People need to quit making any reason they can to not take blame for actions they made under there own decision to. Elon should counter sue for stupidity.",

Not only is he at the cutting edge of 21st-century technology. But, as of this video, he is also the richest man in the world, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaire List. \nElon owns approximately 48% of Space X. A company revolutionizing the commercial space industry and leading the charge in making human beings a multi-planetary species. \nHe also owns 23% of Tesla Motors. A company that probably needs no introduction. In the last decade, Musk and Tesla have come to dominate the Electric Car market. \n\nIn the last year alone, Tesla\u2019s Market Capitalization has grown from US$ 100 Billion in Jan 2020, to US$ 1.12 Trillion as of 30th October 2021! \nThis makes Tesla Motors, the largest automaker in the world in terms of valuation. Surpassing legacy companies like Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, and BMW combined!\n\nThis made us think, what does Elon Musk have to say about his competitors and the future of the EV market?\n\nStick around as we take a look at some of Tesla\u2019s main competitors and Musk\u2019s opinion about them.",
