Russia could go bankrupt and end the war in Ukraine.\u00a0 I think we live in an horrible world, and I was said it is the only one we have. I have to keep trying. I am not given a voice in any news media in the world. Being everything else the same a country without gold is wealthier, live better thanks to their understanding of money, that is transferable debt, a number that indicates value and a name, the issuer of the promise to give value for value at the same market value or price and different utility for buyer and seller, otherwise the exchange would not take place, benefiting both equally, increasing equally their wealth, than a country with gold that protect a yellow, bright, durable, divisible, mouldable, electric conductor, not particularly beautiful, and rare mineral useless inside a vault, because in the country with no gold don\u2019t have to work to pay the extreme cost of mining, transportation, minting, storage, protection. Gold is not money and exchanging gold for goods and services is barter.\u00a0Gold mining would end when the price collapse as all the gold reserves in the world are sold, being the last the foolest, and companies would not be profitable saving the environment from destruction.\nIs not absurd to have to dig out gold to exchange goods and services? Money can be created to buy to sell costless without authorisation because is a sellable contract to give value for value, fulfilled with honour and accepted voluntarily if the issuer is trustworthy, and can be stored in the mind. \u201cI promise i would give the bearer the price in value without cheating, lying, hiding, stealing aiming at giving satisfaction, wellbeing, wealth, happiness.\u201d\nKind regards,\nMiguel.",

Before agreeing to buy the company outright on April 14, he owned 73 million shares at an average price of $36.16.\n\nTwitter shares hit $51.70 on April 25 - which would have represented a $1.1 billion profit for Musk. But they've since fallen 31% to below $36 - turning that billion-dollar gain into a $40 million loss.\n\nTwitter fell 6% Tuesday as investors sold off social media and advertising stocks after Snap announced it would miss its second-quarter revenue target.

So should I call liberal hypocrite Jeff Bezos or I should he be called Jeff Bozo for questioning whether Twitter \ud83d\udc25 will fall under the influence of the Chinese regime, hours after Tesla CEO Elon Musk secured a $44 billion buyout of the social media firm. It\u2019s funny when Liberal Jeff Bezo purchased the Washington Post Newspaper and turned it into the liberal mouthpiece for the Democrat party, none of the fake news liberal media said a word. Fake news CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, New York Times never did any criticism of Jeff Bezos purchase of the Washington Post. And they wonder why smart people now call them liberal fake news. We can call them all hypocrites as well. I think Jeff Bezos is jealous Elon Musk is smarter, has more money and better rockets then Bezos has.",
            "Dems are losing their minds that people will be able to publicly publish stories and have conversations that go against their narrative. Sorry guys, free speech is a thing. Now it will be unlocked on a major scale. Thanks Elon , for supporting our 1st amendment rights more than the politicians elected to do so. Dems, enjoy the world you voted for!
