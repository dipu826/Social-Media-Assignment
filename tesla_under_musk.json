            "Victory\nIn the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.[48:29]\nMuhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers wiith (the sight of) them. Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness and immense reward.\n\n\n[33:45]\nO Prophet! Lo! We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner.\n\n[33:46]\nAnd as a summoner unto Allah by His permission, and as a lamp that giveth light.\n\n[33:47]\nAnd announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great bounty from Allah.\n\n[33:48]\nAnd incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard their noxious talk, and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.\n\n[4:69]\nWhoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they!\n\n[4:70]\nThat is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower.\n\n\n[7:155]\nAnd Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and, when the trembling came on them, he said: My Lord! If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before, and me with them. Wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did ? It is but Thy trial (of us). Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt: Thou art our Protecting Friend, therefore forgive us and have mercy on us, Thou, the Best of all who show forgiveness.\n\n\n[7:156]\nAnd ordain for us in this world that which is good, and in the Hereafter (that which is good), Lo! We have turned unto Thee. He said: I smite with My punishment whom I will, and My mercy embraceth all things, therefore I shall ordain it for those who ward off (evil) and pay the poor- due, and those who believe Our revelations;\n\n\n[7:157]\nThose who follow the messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel (which are) with them. He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong. He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul; and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear. Then those who believe in him, and honour him, and help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him: they are the successful.\n\n\n[7:158]\nSay (O Muhammad): O mankind! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah to you all - (the messenger of) Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and He giveth death. So believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believeth in Allah and in His Words, and follow him that haply ye may be led aright.\n\n\n[33:56]\nLo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.\n\n\n[66:8]\nO ye who believe! Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands; they will say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! Lo! Thou art Able to do all things.\n\n\n[21:107]\nWe sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\u061b",

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi\u00a0\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has sold another 934,090 shares, or about $1.02 billion worth of his holdings, in his electric car and solar business according to financial filings published late Tuesday.\n\nMusk also exercised options to buy nearly 1.6 million Tesla shares at a strike price of $6.24 per share, granted to him via a 2012 compensation package.\n\nIn exercising his options this quarter, Musk\u2019s holdings in Tesla have increased from about 170.5 million shares to over 177 million shares, the Wall Street Journal first reported.\n\nSince Nov. 8, Musk has been on a selling spree, partly to pay his looming tax bills on those options.\n\nThe celeb-CEO polled his tens of millions of Twitter followers in the first week of November asking if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. They voted yes. But a major portion of the sales that followed the entertaining Twitter poll were part of a plan that Musk adopted in September this year.\n\nUnder 10b5-1 rules, corporate insiders (including CEOs) can trade their own equity as part of pre-announced portfolio management plan. They must declare in advance when and how they plan to trade to protect themselves from later accusations of insider trading.\n\nThis year, Tesla shares have risen more than 54% making Musk the world\u2019s wealthiest person. His net worth is now over $275 billion, according to estimates by Forbes.\n\nThat wealth is derived from Musk\u2019s ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX. He currently doesn\u2019t take a salary or cash bonuses, and had not sold a large number of shares in Tesla until this year. He had, instead, taken out sizable loans against a portion of his Tesla shares.\n\nSince taxpayers only pay taxes on income or stock once it is sold, Musk never paid a large amount in taxes annually relative to his net worth, ProPublica previously reported.\n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tweeted that Musk was \u201cfreeloading off everyone else,\u201d since he didn\u2019t pay federal income taxes in 2018.\n\nNow, Musk is expected to pay what is likely to be the largest single individual tax bill in U.S. history, with federal and California income taxes estimated to top $11 billion. He will be required to pay this tax bill in order to receive compensation of more than $23 billion, in the form of stock options that would otherwise expire in August.\n\nThe centi-billionaire discussed his riches and tax strategy during a bevy of December press appearances, including interviews with the Financial Times and Time Magazine after both outlets both named him person of the year for 2021.\n\nCapping off his year-end publicity efforts, Elon Musk sat with the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee on Tuesday last week. During that interview he said, \u201cI sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option exercise stuff and I tried to be extremely literal here.\u201d\n\nThe next day on Twitter, Musk clarified, \u201cThis assumes completion of the 10b sale.\u201d And noted, \u201cWhen the 10b preprogrammed sales complete. There are still a few tranches left, but almost done\u201d in a subsequent tweet.\n\nBy some estimates, Musk still has more than a million more shares to sell to reach his 10% November target of around 17 million shares. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment or more information about the sum total he plans to sell to hit that goal.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk sold nearly $5 billion in Tesla stock, according to financial filings out Wednesday evening. He still holds more than 166 million shares.\n\nHis trust sold more than 3.5 million shares worth over $3.88 billion in a flurry of trades carried out Tuesday and Wednesday. Those transactions were not marked as 10b5, meaning they were not scheduled sales.\n\nEarlier Wednesday evening, filings showed Musk is selling a separate block of Tesla shares via a plan that he set in motion on Sept. 14 this year. Those sales amount to more than 930,000 shares worth over $1.1 billion.\n\nMusk sold these shares in part to satisfy tax obligations related to an exercise of stock options.\n\nBefore that sale plan was made public, Musk asked his 62.5 million Twitter followers to vote in an informal poll, telling them their vote would determine the future of his Tesla holdings. The filings reveal that, in fact, he knew some of his shares were slated for sale this week.\n\nFollowing the Twitter poll, shares of Tesla slumped more 15% over Monday and Tuesday, before rebounding more than 4% on Wednesday.\n\nThe stock was higher in after-hours trade on Thursday.\n\nCitadel CEO Ken Griffin, speaking at the DealBook Online Summit on Wednesday, said he personally did not want to see Musk sell. \u201cIndividuals like Elon Musk, like Jeff Bezos have transformed life, and we want to keep them in control of their companies, as long as they\u2019ve got the energy and the ambition to keep moving the business forward.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Musk signaled that he was likely to sell \u201ca huge block\u201d of his options in the fourth quarter. At an appearance at the Code Conference in September, Musk said when his stock options expire at Tesla, his marginal tax rate would be over 50%.\n\nCurrent and former board members including chairwoman Robyn Denholm, Elon Musk\u2019s brother Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias have offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla shares since Oct. 28 after Tesla\u2019s market cap surpassed $1 trillion.\n\nAmong those insider sales, Kimbal Musk\u2019s was the only transaction that was not listed as a 10b5, or planned sale. Kimbal Musk sold around $109 million worth of his shares a day ahead of his brother\u2019s Twitter poll.\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic \n\nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Other than that, he should really stop whining about a one-time billionaires tax, which would be used to fund _the very same infrastructure_ his products depend on! And not only that, but he could only have made a profit if he took advantage of the infrastructure that was paid with taxpayer's money (distribution services using public highways, employees commuting to work, etc.). Yes, it's about time he pays back into the system, and all others like him who were able to reap the benefits of a rigged game for far too long. Would he rather see poor ol' Joe across the street who's barely able to afford rent pay more in taxes than he does? I sure hope not; but there is no doubt in my mind that _some_ billionaires in this country would secretly answer in the affirmative. I'm all for space exploration --- but let's make sure that the basic needs of the American people (healthcare, housing, education, etc.) are met first. Are we all okay with that? Good.\n\nAnd by the way, I voted yes on that Twitter poll. Now let's hope the next one is about whether he should pay the same tax rate as everyone else, let alone more."

Current level of technology is impressive but the stretch to the required FSD level is still large.  Most people who are not in this field believe that this is just a matter of a little more effort and more money.   But this is a more fundamental problem.

His companies are very successful, strong and resourceful... this is a natural effect from 1st principles thinking and not a neccesitive goal of Elon and his mission. He must enter India for there is where many cars are spewing pollutants into the environment....and so this environment must transition asap. It just so happens that the best way to transition a market quickly is to also do so intelligently. The irony is Tesla can appear as a ruthless competitor taking over the market when in fact they are merely sticking to a simple original path. Tesla will work and will succeed and will become the largest  company to ever exist while simultaneously transforming the earths biosphere/ecosystem into a much healthier, vibrant, ALIVE one. When you include the other components to Elons mission such as x app in particular... meant to be the everything app built by the person who is likely one of the best \"off the cuff\"/out of box thinking programmers on the planet combined with a HUGE TEAM, an army if you will,  of people who are the best at what they do AND are given an excellent wage and benefits... why? Because its nice, because it is the right thing to do, sure both these things... but is is smart money wise... short term, creating a \"lean mean fighting machine\" as is the general business model... absolutely not... but is it the wisest... the most intelligent... long term \"tactic\" for the overall mission? Yes. Why ... because the missions success is all that matters, first principles thinking is literally the first principle and the purpose of the mission/business itself... accruing wealth, power, market share etc are.merwly symptoms of.a.mission succeeding..... why? Because Elon created a company to make hime.the richest in the world ever? No, to make him the most powerful man on earth able to move mts at a whim? No... and to be honest Elon is none of these things, although it may appear so and many media presentations will focus on this b3ing the case the are.missing.the forrest for the trees.
